<ul><li>INTRODUCTION

</ul><p>Congratulations on choosing the Street
Electronics ECHO Two speech synthesis system. Whether you will be using it
for games, education, aiding the handicapped or any of its other
applications, you will find that the ECHO Two's superior ease of use and
speech quality make it the most versatile Apple compatible plug-in speech
board on the market today. We are confident that this is only the
beginning of a long and satisfying relationship between yourself and the
ECHO Two. The first thing that you will probably want to do is to sit down
and try it out for yourself. That's a good attitude. All we ask is that
you control yourself for ten minutes, sit down at your computer with this
entire pac age, and continue reading through this Introduction, the Table
of Contents, the Introduction to the Manual, and the Installation
instructions. We know that you want to do this right! Within 10 minutes
you will be listening to speech from your Apple Two!

<h1>INTRODUCTION TO THE MANUAL</h1>
<p>We have attempted to make this manual both informative
and easy-to-use. It was designed to accomodate the not-so-experienced user
as well as the more experienced. Each section is meant to be read from
beginning to end and to be used in conjunction with the ECHO Two. By the
end of each section you should have not only an understanding of the
material covered, but also experience with it.

<p>The 3 main sections of the manual concern (1)
installation of and introduction to the ECHO Two, its software and this
manual, also some very basic help for the less experienced Apple user; (2)
The TEXTALKER (TM) software tutorial and (3) the SPEAKEASY(TM) software
tutorial. There is also a section on the ECHO's exclusive features to aid
blind users, a technical or advanced section and various appendices. These
sections are all outlined in more detail in the table of contents. Turn
the page for installation instructions and you are on your way.

<h1>INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
<ul><li>To install the ECHO Two (TM), simply plug it into any
slot inside your Apple(TM) computer (except 0) as follows:

<li>1. TURN OFF THE POWER TO THE COMPUTER. This is important
and will prevent damage to your computer or the ECHO.

<li>2. Push the speaker cable into the jack labelled "speaker"
on the ECHO.

<li>3. Remove the cover from your Apple. This is done by
pulling up on the cover at the rear edge (the edge farthest from the
keyboard) just until the two corner fasteners pop apart. Do not lift the
edge any further, but instead slide the cover backwards until it comes
free.

<li>4. Inside the Apple, along the rear edge of the large
circuit board, there is a series of eight long, narrow sockets called
"slots." The slots are numbered 0 through 7, with the leftmost slot (the
one to your left as you face the computer from the keyboard end) being
slot #0. The ECHO may be installed in any of these slots except this zero
slot.

<li>5. Be sure the power is off. To install the ECHO into your
chosen slot, insert the gold "fingers" (the gold bars along the lower
jutting edge of the ECHO) into the slot using a gentle rocking motion
until the board is firmly seated.

<li>6. Attach the speaker to the inside, right wall of your
Apple using the tape provided.

<li>7. Replace the cover of the Apple by sliding the front edge
of the cover into place and then pressing down on the rear corners until
they snap closed.

</ul><h1>TESTING</h1>
<p>If you have some experience with the Apple, you may
now test the ECHO by booting the diskette that came with it and running
the program called SEC DEMO. This program shows some of the features of
the ECHO. To end the program type a Control-C. You should now also copy
your diskette. If you do not understand what was just said, don't worry.
You will be able to test the ECHO after reading the following two sections
on "KEYBOARD NOTATION" and "BOOTING A DISKETTE."

<h1>KEYBOARD NOTATION</h1>
<p>In this section you will be introduced to a simple
notation system which will show you exactly what to type on your Apple
keyboard. For instance, when we want you to type the word "HELLO" you will
see: H E L L O [transcriber's note: the manual has special boxes to
enclose each keystroke. In this version, the keystrokes will be in
computer braille and spaced apart]
<p>Each boxed letter represents a key on your Apple's
keyboard. Of course, for some characters you are required to hold down one
key while pressing another.

<p>For example, to type an exclamation point (!), you
must hold down the SHIFT key while pressing the 1 key (just as you would
on an ordinary typewriter). However, we show only the exclamation point.

<p>!

<p>When it is necessary for you to type a "control
character" we will print this:

<ul><li>CTRL/E

</ul><p>The upper key should be held down while you press
the lower key. So, typing a Control-E is similar to typing a Shift-E
except that you press the CTRL key instead of SHIFT. Note that when you
type a control character nothing will appear on the screen.

<ul><li>ERROR MESSAGES

</ul><p>If you accidently misspell something then, most
likely, the Apple will reject it by printing "SYNTAX ERROR" on your screen
and emitting a "beep" from its speaker. This is not a problem, but you
will need to type the line over again. REMEMBER: Don't ignore syntax
errors - you must retype the line!

<ul><li>BOOTING A DISKETTE

</ul><p>Several programs are included for use with your
ECHO and they can be found on the diskette that came with the ECHO. To
discover exactly what programs are on the diskette, you must "boot" and
"CATALOG" this diskette. The process of adding DOS (Disk Operating System)
commands to your Apple is called "booting" the diskette and is
accomplished by following the simple steps outlined below.

<p>1. Insert the diskette into the disk drive with the
label facing upwards. The edge of the diskette with the label should enter
the drive last. If you have more than one drive, place the diskette in
Drive #1.

<p>2. Turn on the power to your Apple. If it is already
on, then turn it off and then on again. This clears the memory and, on
most Apples, automatically boots the diskette. If the disk drive is now
making a whirring noise and the red "in use" light on the drive is lit -
Congratulations! The deed is done. The diskette is booted and you should
skip to step 4. If, on the the other hand, your disk drive is just sitting
there not making a sound, and there is an asterisk (*) in the lower
lefthand corner of the screen, then proceed to step 3. Now if your disk
drive is not whirring or showing any other signs of activity, and your
screen does not show an asterisk (you did remember to turn on your t.v. or
monitor, right?), then please check your DOS manual to make sure that your
disk drive is installed properly.

<ul><li>3. Type:

<li>6 CTRL/P RETURN

</ul><p>Now it should boot. Congratulations. (If it still
does not work, then check your DOS manual.)

<ul><li>4. If you have not yet tested your ECHO, type:

<li>R U N SPACE S E C SPACE D E M O RETURN

<li>To end the program type:

<li>E N D RETURN

<li>Also, if you have not already copied the diskette do so now
by placing your DOS 3.3 Master diskette in drive 1 and typing:

<li>R U N SPACE C O P Y A RETURN

</ul><p>Follow the instructions with this program and
when you are finished put the original diskette in a safe place and boot
the copy. You should always use a copy.

<ul><li>THE CATALOG

</ul><p>If you have not already done so, please boot the
ECHO diskette. The Apple will now respond to commands concerning the
diskette. Type:

<ul><li>C A T A L O G RETURN

</ul><p>A "listing" or "catalog" of program names and
other information will appear. We will now show you how to interpret and
use this information.

<p>At the top of the catalog the words "DISK VOLUME 254"
appear. Every diskette is assigned a volume number when it is set up to
store programs. The volume does not concern us here, so we will not
discuss it any further. (If you are really curious you can check your DOS
manual). The next line of the catalog looks like this:

<ul><li>*A 002 HELLO

</ul><p>The word "HELLO" is the name of the first program
on the diskette. Whenever this diskette is booted, HELLO is automatically
run. This program simply prints a short message and a copyright notice.
The number to the left of the program name (002) is a measure of the space
on the diskette that is used to store this program. Disks are divided into
"sectors," and each sector can hold 256 characters. The HELLO program uses
2 sectors of storage. The letter "A" to the left of the "002" indicates
that the program is written in APPLESOFT(TM). APPLESOFT is a version of
the BASIC programming language. We will be writing a short and simple
APPLESOFT program later on in this manual, and all of our examples will
assume that you are using APPLESOFT. You can tell if your Apple is ready
to understand APPLESOFT by checking the "prompt" on your screen. If this
character, which appears before the flashing square (the "cursor"), is a
"]" then your Apple is ready for commands in APPLESOFT. If the prompt is
just a flashing square that means that there is more to the catalog. Press
any key you like and the catalog will continue to list, one full screen at
a time, until the entire catalog has been listed. At this point, the
normal prompt will appear (usually a "]" followed by a flashing square).

<p>Instead of the letter "A" you may find any of the
following letters:

<p>I - This means that the program is written in "INTEGER
BASIC" which is another of the programming languages available for the
Apple.

<p>B - This means that the information stored here is
stored in "Binary" form. It may be a program; it may be data; it could
even be a high resolution picture. There is no way to tell from looking at
the catalog listing. You just have to trust the literature that comes with
the diskette (in this case, you have got to trust us!) T - The "T"
indicates that this is a text file. A text file is characters: letters,
words, etc.- that is, "text," stored as a group (file) on the diskette.

<p>The asterisk (*) which precedes the catalog entry
indicates that this entry is "locked." "Locking" a program is a way of
protecting the program from being accidentally deleted or erased from the
diskette. If you did want to erase the program, you would first need to
"unlock" it. This procedure is explained in more detail in your DOS
manual. Now that you have some familiarity with the catalog, we will now
offer a brief explanation of what each of the programs listed on your
diskette can do.

<ul><li>SOFTWARE

<li>HELLO is automatically run when you boot this disk. It runs
the HELLO.LOGO program and then pauses for about 10 seconds before
exiting. You may press any key at any time during the HELLO program and it
will exit immediately.

<li>HELLO.LOGO is the program which displays the TEXTALKER
LOGO.

<li>ECHO COM is a communications aid for non-oral individuals.
This program allows you to create messages to be spoken by selecting words
and sentences from user created menus.

<li>LIST BUILDER allows you to create word lists for use in the
SPELLING TEST program.

<li>LIST0 is a sample word list which can be used with the
SPELLING TEST program.

<li>PHONEME TRANSLATOR translates words into their equivalent
SPEAKEASY phoneme codes. (More on this in the SPEAKEASY tutorial.)

<li>ROBOT.DEMO loads into memory and displays ROBOT.PICT. It
then allows you to type in phrases which will then be spoken in a robotic
voice.

<li>ROBOT.PICT is the picture used in ROBOT.DEMO. SEC DEMO
displays SEC DEMO.PICT and gives a short demonstration of the ECHO Two.

<li>SEC DEMO.PICT is the picture used by SEC DEMO.

<li>SPEAKEASY is a program which allows you to use speech in
your own programs by using special phoneme codes. The advantages of this
program over TEXTALKER for certain applications is covered in the
SPEAKEASY tutorial.

<li>SPELLING TEST tests spelling ability by speaking words and
then checking the typed response for spelling accuracy.

<li>TALKING TYPEWRITER names each character on the Apple
keyboard as the key is pressed.

<li>The TEXTALKER programs allow you to have the Apple say a
word when you type in the word. These programs utilize nearly 400 rules of
pronunciation to correctly convert your typed text to speech.

<li>Use TEXTALKER if you do not own a RAM card.

<li>TEXTALKER.RAM is used instead of TEXTALKER if you own a RAM
card because it loads the TEXTALKER program into your RAM card, thus
giving you more available memory for your programs. This version of
TEXTALKER also has special features for users who are blind.

<li>TEXTALKER.BLIND contains all the same features as
TEXTALKER.RAM, but does not require a RAM card. Use this program if you
need the features for the blind, and you do not own a RAM card.

<li>TEXTALKER.RAM.OBJ is the program that is loaded into the
RAM card when you run TEXTALKER.RAM. This program can not be run or loaded
separately of TEXTALKER.RAM.

<li>TEXTALKER(TM) TUTORIAL

</ul><p>In order for you to get the ECHO to speak you
must use one of the following programs: TEXTALKER(TM), TEXTALKER.RAM(TM),
TEXTALKER.BLIND(TM) or SPEAKEASY(TM). Once you have run one of these
programs you will not need to run it again unless you re-boot a diskette
or turn the computer off. Each of these programs, when run, will slightly
modify your DOS (Disk Operating System). Because of this it is a good idea
for you to initialize any new diskettes with an unmodified DOS, like that
on your system master diskette. In the following sections we will assume
that you are using the TEXTALKER program. All of the commands used in
TEXTALKER are also used in TEXTALKER.RAM and TEXTALKER.BLIND.
TEXTALKER.RAM and TEXTALKER.BLIND have a few additional commands designed
for users who are blind. These additional commands are covered in the
section titled "Features to Aid Blind Users." To run TEXTALKER type:

<ul><li>B R U N SPACE T E X T A L K E R RETURN

</ul><p>Note that you should type "BRUN" and not "RUN."
If you typed "RUN" your Apple responded with a"FILE TYPE MISMATCH ERROR"
because this is a binary file and not an APPLESOFT file. If you made this
error you should simply retype the line. After the disk drive stops
whirring you will see the following message on your screen:

<ul><li>TEXTALKER (TM) ECHO Two SPEECH GENERATOR VERSION 1.3
COPYRIGHT 1981 VISEK,MAGGS,STREET &amp; KORY

</ul><p>Do not worry if the version number is different.
Running TEXTALKER.RAM or TEXTALKER.BLIND is accomplished in the same way
(except that you would type a different program name of course). We will
cover SPEAKEASY in a separate section.

<p>You are probably ready to hear the ECHO speak. Type:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " H E L L O " RETURN

</ul><p>You probably noticed that the ECHO said each
letter as you typed it and, when you pressed RETURN, that it said the word
"HELLO." If this was not the case, then make sure that you typed exactly
what is shown above, especially the quotes. (Notice that the ECHO did not
say anything when you typed the quotation marks. Later we will show you
how to have punctuation spoken.) If you want to hear it again, then just
type it again. What did we just do anyway? Well, the word "PRINT" is an
APPLESOFT BASIC command. Anything in quotation marks that follows this
command will be printed on the screen. The TEXTALKER program is also at
work. It looks at everything printed to the screen and pronounces it to
the best of its ability. Pressing the RETURN key signals the Apple that
this is the end of the command, and that it should now carry out that
command - in this case it should print and speak the word "HELLO." Using
this information you can now make the ECHO say anything that you want. For
example, you could type:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " I SPACE A M SPACE E C H O " RETURN

</ul><p>Go ahead and play around a little, it will help
you to get a feel for the ECHO and also allow your ear to become better
accustomed to the ECHO's speech. Try CATALOGing the diskette again and
listen to the ECHO read it to you.

<ul><li>MISPRONUNCIATION

</ul><p>Welcome back. While typing in phrases for the
ECHO to speak, you may have come across a word or two which the ECHO has
mispronounced. Although the TEXTALKER program uses many rules (almost 400
in fact) to guide it in correctly pronouncing your text, English is so
full of exceptions to these rules, such as compound words and foreign
words, that it is simply not feasible to make a perfect speech synthesizer
for a microcomputer. With a few simple guidelines, you can help to bridge
the gap between the ECHO and perfection. Our first example involves a
compound word, but the solution to the problem applies to more than just
this type of exceptional word. Type:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " T Y P E W R I T E R " RETURN

<li>The ECHO said what sounded like "Tipwriter." Now type it
again and leave a space between "type" and "writer."

<li>P R I N T SPACE " T Y P E SPACE W R I T E R " RETURN

</ul><p>Often breaking up the word is all that is needed
to correct the pronunciation of an exceptional word. For more examples of
this, type: "equals" (E QUALS), "create" (CRE ATE), and "program" (PRO
GRAM).

<p>Other words may need to be misspelled for them to be
pronounced correctly. For instance, type:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " R O B O T " RETURN

</ul><p>Notice that the first "O" is mispronounced. We
need to change the vowel sound from a short sound to a long sound.
(Remember "sounding out" words phonetically when you learned to read? If
you don't remember--the "short o" sound is the "o" in "rock" and the
"long" sound is found in "row." The long sound of each vowel is its name.)
Try typing "ROWBOT" instead of "ROBOT." By following the "o" with a "w" we
have made the pronunciation of the "o" as a long "o" more consistent with
the patterns of English speech. (The word "robot" is foreign.) Along the
same lines we can change the short "a" sound to a long one by spelling it
"ay," and the short "e" will be pronounced "long" if it is doubled ("ee").
To make a vowel go from long to short, try doubling the following
consonant. Using these hints, your own common-sense knowledge of English,
and experimentation (which is really the key), correct pronunciation will
be made simple. Now, what if you want the ECHO to pronounce one of these
exceptional words correctly and also print it on the screen spelled
correctly? This is not difficult and we will show you how soon.

<p>PRINT or ?

<p>This is a good time to look at an easier way to type
PRINT. APPLESOFT BASIC allows an abbreviation for the word "PRINT" and
that is the question mark (?). Try it.

<ul><li>? " H E L L O " RETURN

</ul><p>We will continue to use PRINT in our examples,
but feel free to type the question mark instead. Also, notice that you
have been hitting the RETURN key at the end of each line. We are going to
stop telling you do this each time. You must take care to remember to hit
RETURN after each command, however, so that the Apple knows that you are
done with that line. Another point of general interest concerns the RESET
key. When you press RESET, or CTRL and RESET on newer Apples, the
TEXTALKER program no longer works. The program is still there, but it can
not react to what is being printed to the screen, so it just sits there.
To revive TEXTALKER (or TEXTALKER.RAM or TEXTALKER.BLIND) type:

<ul><li>P R # 0

</ul><p>Note that the last character is a zero, not the
letter "O". Give it a try; press RESET and then type PR#0 as shown above.

<ul><li>TEXTALKER COMMANDS

</ul><p>The TEXTALKER program has several different modes
in which it can operate. The rest of this tutorial will explain these to
you. Type:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " CTRL/E O "

</ul><p>or...

<p>? " CTRL/E O "

<p>Are you still remembering to press RETURN? If you are
carefully following instructions, you did not type a space after
control-E. You should never type a space after control-E. Now type:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " H E L L O "

</ul><p>The ECHO did not make a sound! Control-E (common
notation for the result of pressing the control key and another letter at
the same time) precedes all ECHO commands so ,whenever you print a
Control-E, the TEXTALKER program interprets the following characters as a
command. In this case the character following was an "O." This command
puts the ECHO into "Output only" mode (get it? "O" for "Output"). In this
mode the computer will print to the screen but the ECHO will remains
silent. Now type:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " CTRL/E T "

</ul><p>This command puts the ECHO into a "Talk only"
mode. In this mode the ECHO will speak, but nothing will be shown on the
screen. Type:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " H E L L O "

<li>To return to the first mode, in which the ECHO does Both
printing and talking, type:

<li>P R I N T SPACE " E B "

</ul><p>Test this mode by printing a message on the
screen.

<p>Notice that all of the commands have been preceded by
a Control-E. Now suppose that for some very practical reason (or even a
totally impractical reason) you do not wish to use Control-E to indicate a
TEXTALKER command. You have to ability to change this if you so desire. To
change the Control-E to Control-Q type:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " CTRL/E CTRL/Q "

</ul><p>Now Control-Q is the new command character. To
double-check the change, type the following commands:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " CTRL/E T "

<li>P R I N T SPACE " H E L L O "

</ul><p>Notice that "HELLO" was printed on the screen,
which it should not have been if we had activated the "Talk only" mode in
this usual way. Now type:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " CTRL/Q T "

<li>P R I N T SPACE " H E L L O "

</ul><p>Now the "Talk only" mode is in effect. Return to
the "Both" mode by typing:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " Q B "

</ul><p>And let us also change the command character back
to a Control-E. Type:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " Q E "

</ul><p>You may change the command character to any
control character. But you should not make it Control-M (which will act
just like the RETURN key), Control-U (the -&gt; ), Control-H (the &lt;- )
or Control-J (a linefeed).

<ul><li>USING THE ECHO WITHIN A PROGRAM

</ul><p>To demonstrate how to use the ECHO from within
your own program, we will now write a short APPLESOFT BASIC program. To
speed things up, first issue the "Output only" command (CONTROL-E O), and
then type:

<ul><li>N E W

</ul><p>to let your Apple know you are about to type a
"new" program. Now type the following lines exactly as shown (including
the line numbers). End each line by pressing the RETURN key, of course.

<ul><li>10 INPUT A$

<li>20 PRINT A$

<li>30 GOTO 10

<li>Now type:

<li>L I S T

</ul><p>and double check your listed program with the
program in the manual. If there is a mistake you just have to retype the
line containing the mistake (including the line number).

<ul><li>A BASIC PRIMER

</ul><p>Those of you who know BASIC should skip this
section. If you do not know much BASIC--stick around. The three line
program that you just typed in is a BASIC program. In BASIC, each command
or instruction must be preceded by a number, which is called a line
number. The Apple will perform these commands in numerical order. The
numbers do not need to be in increments of one however. (For example, in
your program the computer will do line 10 and then line 20--it will not
sit there waiting for line 11.) Our program will therefore perform as
follows... The first line (line 10) uses the BASIC command "INPUT." When
the Apple encounters this command it will print a question mark and wait
for the user (that's you) to type a response as an input. The program will
store what you have typed in its memory and label it "A$." We will assume
that you type in the word "HELLO" as an input. Line 20 contains the
"PRINT" command. We have used the PRINT command before, but only as
followed by a phrase within quotation marks. Since A$ is not in quotes,
the computer will not print the characters "A" and "$," but will instead
print the "value" of A$, which is the input/response to line 10--the word
"HELLO." Therefore, when the Apple encounters line 20, it will print
"HELLO." Line 30 simply tells the computer to "GO TO" line 10 and start
all over again by first asking for an input and then printing the input
and then starting all over again... Let's try running the program. Type:

<ul><li>R U N

</ul><p>Enter any word you like when you see the question
mark, and press RETURN. The Apple will obediently print the word that you
entered and then ask you for another word. To end this limited game, type:

<ul><li>CTRL/C RETURN

</ul><p>in response to the input request (the question
mark). The program will stop and your Apple will tell you that you stopped
it at line 10 of your program, or, in its words, "BREAK IN LINE 10." Now
you can turn the speech function back on and have both that and the screen
output by issuing the now familiar ECHO command:

<ul><li>P R I N T SPACE " CTRL/E B "

</ul><p>Now RUN the program again. Note that you do not
have to put quotation marks around your response to the input request to
hear it spoken unless the phrase contains a comma. Also, keep your
response down to less than six lines (your Apple manuals can explain the
reason for this if you are curious). Type in a few of your favorite
phrases, and also try typing the commands that you have learned. If you do
type a phrase which contains a comma, the ECHO will pause at the comma.
Also note that if you type:

<ul><li>CTRL/E T H E L L O RETURN

</ul><p>the TEXTALKER program will stop printing to the
screen as soon as you enter the T command--even before you press RETURN.

<p>To make our program even easier to use, we will modify
it slightly. First, exit the program by typing:

<ul><li>CTRL/C RETURN

<li>To add the following lines to the program, simply type them
in:

<li>5 PRINT CHR$(5)"O"

<li>15 PRINT CHR$(5)"B"

</ul><p>These lines will automatically assume their place
in proper numerical order within your program. Now change line 30 by
typing:

<ul><li>30 GOTO 5

</ul><p>The Apple will automatically replace the old line
30 with the new one. Now type:

<ul><li>L I S T

</ul><p>Compare your program to the following listing. If
there are any mistakes, just retype the line containing the mistake.

<ul><li>5 PRINT CHR$(5)"O"

<li>10 INPUT A$

<li>15 PRINT CHR$(5)"B"

<li>20 PRINT A$

<li>30 GOTO 5

</ul><p>Again, if you know BASIC, skip this section. You
see that the new line 5 uses the now familiar PRINT command, but that
following it we have "CHR$(5)." This is a BASIC command equivalent to
typing Control-E. (E is the fifth letter of the alphabet, hence the "5" in
parenthesis.) After this comes the letter "O" in quotes. These two parts
of line 5 combine to be the equivalent of typing "Control-E O." The reason
we use the CHR$ command is that when you type Control-E, nothing shows on
the screen, but while using the new command we can now easily check to see
if we remembered to enter Control-E in the program. Line 15 prints out the
ECHO's "Both" command and line 30 now jumps to line 5, the new beginning
of the program.

<p>Our new program works as follows: Line 5 puts the ECHO
in "Output only" mode. This way, when you type your response to line 10,
the ECHO will not speak, which allows you to type faster. Line 15 puts the
ECHO in "Both" mode, so that line 20 both prints and speaks your input.
Line 30 starts the program over again. You may stop the program as you did
before by typing a Control-C instead of an input.

<p>You can probably now see how we would have a word
spelled correctly on the screen, and yet spelled incorrectly for the ECHO
to pronounce. First we would put the ECHO in "Output only" mode and print
the correctly spelled word (e.g. ROBOT). Then we would put the ECHO in
"Talk only" mode and print the word spelled as we would spell it for
pronunciation (i.e. ROWBOT).

<ul><li>RATE MODES

</ul><p>We are now ready to cover some additional modes.
First, if it is not already running, RUN the program that you typed in.
Now enter a sentence at least a few words long (e.g. "RUBBER BABY BUGGY
BUMPERS"), then type:

<ul><li>CTRL/E C

</ul><p>Now type the same sentence again. You are now in
"Compressed" mode in which the speech is compressed--that is, faster. Some
people find the fast mode difficult to understand at first, but only until
they have become accustomed to it. Once you have more experience with the
ECHO, you may find that you are always using the compressed mode. To
return to the slower mode type:

<ul><li>CTRL/E E

</ul><p>You are now in "Expanded" mode in which the
sounds are expanded and, therefore, slower. Type in another phrase to make
sure you entered the "Expanded" mode command correctly.

<ul><li>PRONUNCIATION MODES

</ul><p>Currently you are in "Word" mode, in which the
ECHO pronounces whatever you type as a word. You may also have it spell
out everything letter by letter by typing:

<ul><li>CTRL/E L

<li>Type a few phrases in "Letter" mode and then return to
"Word" mode by typing:

<li>CTRL/E W

<li>PUNCTUATION MODES

</ul><p>You may remember that, earlier in this tutorial,
we promised to show you how to get the ECHO to say the quotation marks as
you typed them in; we will do that now. The punctuation mode that you are
in now pronounces only unusual punctuation (e.g. "#", "$", "%", "&amp;",
"=", "@", "+", "&lt;", "&gt;" and "/") and also a "." if followed
immediately by another character. (For an example of this last point have
the ECHO say "2.9%.") This mode is known as the "Some punctuation" mode.
To get the ECHO to pronounce Most of the punctuation characters type:

<ul><li>CTRL/E M

</ul><p>The ECHO will now pronounce all punctuation
characters except spaces, line feeds (Control-J) and carriage returns
(Control-M or RETURN). The ECHO will say even these if you type:

<ul><li>CTRL/E A

</ul><p>This command puts you in "All punctuation" mode.
To return to the standard "Some punctuation" mode, enter:

<ul><li>CTRL/E S

<li>PITCH MODES

</ul><p>It is also possible to adjust the "Pitch" of the
ECHO. Type:

<ul><li>CTRL/E 4 0 P

</ul><p>Type in a short phrase. Notice that the voice of
the Echo has a higher pitch now. You may vary the pitch by varying the
number in the command from 1 to 63. Try some different pitches now. When
you are done, return the pitch level to a middle value, or back to the
original pitch level of 22. Now type "ARE YOU HAPPY?". Listen carefully as
the ECHO's pitch changes at the end of the sentence. Since the sentence
ends in a question mark, the pitch rises, just as it does in normal human
speech. Compare this with "ARE YOU HAPPY" (no punctuation) and "ARE YOU
HAPPY." (with a period). When the sentence ends in a period, exclamation
point or a colon, the ECHO's pitch will drop. If the sentence ends with a
question mark or semi-colon the pitch will rise. Notice too that some
variations in pitch exist within each word.

<p>If you would like the ECHO to speak in a robotic tone,
you can put it in "Flat pitch" mode by typing:

<ul><li>CTRL/E 2 2 F

</ul><p>You may vary the pitch by changing the number
here from 1 through 63 also. Type in a few phrases and notice that when
the ECHO speaks now, its pitch does not vary within the sentence.

<ul><li>VOLUME MODES

</ul><p>If you are working/playing with the ECHO late at
night, you, or perhaps a loved one, may appreciate the ECHO's ability to
speak at different volume levels. To set the volume, use the ECHO command
:

<ul><li>CTRL/E 5 V

</ul><p>The number may vary from 0 through 15. You may
also use this mode to create special effects such as an "echo" for the
ECHO. Try setting the volume at different levels. Notice that at the
higher levels, the volume of fricatives (F,H,S,SH,TH) increases without a
corresponding increase in the the volume of some of the other sounds.
Also, the lower levels sound like a whisper. To adjust the volume without
these effects, you may turn the volume potentiometer on the ECHO itself.
The potentiometer is the small knob near the top of the ECHO with word
"VOL" located to its immediate left. Turning the knob counter clockwise
lowers the volume and turning it clockwise increases the volume.

<ul><li>LIST CONTROL COMMANDS

</ul><p>The last two commands can best be explained
without running the program that you have typed in. Remember that to stop
the program you type:

<ul><li>CTRL/C RETURN

<li>Now set the ECHO into the "Both" mode and type:

<li>C A T A L O G

<li>To halt the ECHO in mid sentence type the following without
pressing RETURN:

<li>CTRL/S

</ul><p>To continue the catalog press any key. Now type:

<ul><li>C A T A L O G

<li>again and, while it is listing, type the following, again
without pressing RETURN:

<li>CTRL/X

</ul><p>Note that the catalog continues to list, but that
the ECHO remains silent. Control-X puts the ECHO in "Output only" mode
until the Apple requests an input. After the catalog stops listing, the
Apple waits for a command (input) which puts the ECHO back into "Both"
mode.

<p>This about concludes our discussion of the TEXTALKER
commands and operating modes. You should know that you may combine the
modes in many different combinations. You can have, for example, the "Flat
pitch" mode and "Letter" mode and the "All punctuation" mode all active at
the same time. If you need to review these commands; see the reference
card for a complete listing, along with brief explanations of the
commands.

<ul><li>SPEAKEASY(TM) TUTORIAL

</ul><p>The SPEAKEASY program generates speech very
differently from the TEXTALKER programs. In the TEXTALKER programs, you
printed a word and the ECHO spoke the word. In SPEAKEASY you will be
printing phonemes to generate speech. Phonemes are the smallest
distinguishable sound units of a language. The word "speech," for example,
is composed of six letters, but only four phonemes: they represent the "s"
sound, the "p" sound, the "long e" sound and the "ch" sound. Since
SPEAKEASY works at the phoneme level, you will be able to have words
pronounced exactly as you wish. SPEAKEASY was developed to be used within
your programs, to give them new animation and uses. Also, if you do not
have a RAM card or can not spare the 8K of memory that the TEXTALKER
programs require, SPEAKEASY will give you speech capability while using
only 3K of memory.

<p>There are a couple of ways to run SPEAKEASY. The
TEXTALKER programs contain SPEAKEASY, so if you have already put TEXTALKER
into memory, then SPEAKEASY is also already in memory. If you want to just
use SPEAKEASY, and we will assume in our examples that this is the case,
then just "boot" the diskette (this procedure is explained in detail in
the section called "Booting a Diskette") and type:

<ul><li>B R U N SPACE S P E A K E A S Y

</ul><p>Using the SPEAKEASY (TM) program rather than a
TEXTALKER program insures that SPEAKEASY will work even if you press RESET
or issue a "PR#" command. Your monitor or television screen should look
like this:

<ul><li>SPEAKEASY ECHO II PHONEME GENERATOR VERSION 1.1

</ul><p>COPYRIGHT 1981 STREET ELECTRONICS CORP.

<p>Don't worry if your version number is different.

<ul><li>ENCODING PHONEMES

</ul><p>To use SPEAKEASY you will need to have the
reference card handy. There you will find a table which shows all of the
phonemes and associated SPEAKEASY codes that you will be using to create
speech. The first column contains an example of a common word containing a
clear instance of a sound. The second column shows the common dictionary
symbol for the sound, and the third shows the symbol that you will
actually be typing into the computer to represent that sound. Using this
table we can see that the word "speech" (to continue with our previous
example) would be written in SPEAKEASY code as SP&amp;C. The word "echo"
would be EKO.

<p>To actually hear the ECHO speak these words, type in
the following short program:

<ul><li>20 V$=CHR$(22)

<li>30 PRINT V$"EKO"

<li>40 PRINT V$"SP&amp;C"

<li>50 PRINT "DONE"

<li>Now type:

<li>L I S T

</ul><p>Double check your listing of the program you just
typed in against the listing in this manual. As always, if there are any
mistakes retype the line and list again. The way this program will work is
that line 20 will make "V$" equal to a Control-V ("V" being the 22nd
letter of the alphabet). This is done because every word that you want to
have spoken by SPEAKEASY will have to be preceded by a Control-V. Line 30
will print the "value" of V$ (Control-V), thus alerting the SPEAKEASY
program that it must speak the phoneme codes which follow it (E,K, and O).
Line 40 will similarly say "S," "P," "&amp;" and "C." Line 50 will print
"DONE" without speaking because there is no Control-V preceding it. Try
the program now by typing:

<ul><li>R U N

</ul><p>It is useful to note that SPEAKEASY will
pronounce everything following a Control-V until it encounters a "carriage
return." In BASIC a carriage return is automatically generated at the end
of each PRINT command unless it is followed by a semi-colon (;). To better
understand and use this feature, retype lines 30 and 40 like this:

<ul><li>30 PRINT V$"EKO";

<li>40 PRINT "SP&amp;C"

</ul><p>Type "LIST" to review the program and double
check your changes and then "RUN" the program again. This time the ECHO
said both "EKO" and "SP&amp;C" even though, on line 40, "SP&amp;C" was not
preceded by a Control-V (V$). This is because line 30 ended with a
semi-colon which cancelled the carriage return which would have told
SPEAKEASY to stop speaking.

<ul><li>THE PHONEME EDITOR

</ul><p>SPEAKEASY also includes a phoneme editor which
makes experimentation with putting words into their phoneme codes easier.
To enter the editor simply type:

<ul><li>&amp; RETURN

</ul><p>You will now see a quotation mark for a prompt.
Now type:

<ul><li>E K O

</ul><p>The ECHO will say "EKO." Note that a Control-V
was not necessary. You can continue to type in words and hear them
pronounced in this manner, making changes using the Apple's normal editing
commands. You may also type in more than one encoded word at a time. Try
typing "I am ECHO" which encodes as:

<ul><li>! A M E K O

</ul><p>When you are finished experimenting, you can quit
the editor by pressing RETURN instead of entering any phoneme codes. Use
this editor to type in the words for the rest of the examples presented.

<ul><li>INFLECTION/STRESS

<li>Type:

<li>E K O

</ul><p>Listen carefully. Now type:

<ul><li>E 3 K O

</ul><p>Note that this time the "E" is more stressed. The
number 0,1,2 or 3 following a vowel, diphthong or "r-colored vowel" (you
will see these categories on your reference card) determines the stress of
that phoneme. If no stress number is given then a value of 2 is used.
Using a 3 gives greater stress by making the phoneme higher in pitch,
longer in duration, or both. Try retyping "E3KO" and substituting 2,1 and
0 for the 3. The 1 reduces the stress placed on the phoneme by making it
lower in pitch and shorter. A stress of 0 reduces the sound to what is
termed a "schwa." The schwa also has its own code (') which can be used.

<ul><li>PITCH AND RATE

</ul><p>The base pitch of the ECHO is set using the same
commands that we used in TEXTALKER (i.e. Control-E40P, Control-E40F...).
These are outlined in more detail in the TEXTALKER tutorial. You may also
set the rate of speech (speed) using TEXTALKER commands (i.e. Control-E C
and Control-E E).These commands can not be issued from within the phoneme
editor, however. (If you have already tried it, press Control-RESET.) To
issue these commands, exit the editor by pressing RETURN instead of
entering any phonemes. Now enter the command as you would in TEXTALKER,
for example:

<ul><li>P R I N T " CTRL/E 4 0 P "

<li>Now re-enter the editor by typing:

<li>&amp; RETURN

</ul><p>SPEAKEASY allows you to adjust the pitch within a
word too. Simply insert a number from 1 through 9 anywhere within a word
except following a vowel or a diphthong (where it would be considered a
stress number). The base pitch is 5 and 9 is the highest pitch. The pitch
will remain at the new level until it is reset, or until the first "stop
consonant" or "fricative" is encountered. Try typing: **************

<p>F5 .RM+20 9<!--#[_H]#-->9<!--#[_H]#-->9 ! 3 7<!--#[_H]#-->7<!--#[_H]#-->7 A M
5<!--#[_H]#-->5<!--#[_H]#-->5 A N 3<!--#[_H]#-->3<!--#[_H]#-->3 E 3 K 1<!--#[_H]#-->1<!--#[_H]#-->1 O 3 .RM-20
$p********** The numbers in bold print set the pitch level, while the
numbers following the vowels set the stress level as explained earlier.
This may seem a little confusing at first, so try experimenting with
different combinations and familiarize yourself with the system.

<p>Another way to modify the pitch is by using the
symbols "&gt;," "&lt;" and "=." The "&gt;" symbol will set up a pattern of
rising pitch, the "&lt;" symbol sets up a pattern of falling pitch, and
flat pitch is set up using the "=" symbol. All sounds will continue to
vary in the pitch pattern that you have set until either a fricative, stop
consonant, or a pitch level change is encountered. Try typing the word
"help" using these symbols. You might type:

<ul><li>H &lt; E E E E L L L L P

</ul><p>or...

<ul><li>H &lt; E E E E E E E E E E E E &gt; L L L L L L L L L L
L L P RETURN

<li>VOLUME CONTROL

</ul><p>SPEAKEASY allows you to adjust the volume of
speech within your programs by using "+" and "-." Typing a "+" increases
the volume and the "-" decreases it. You may also type a series of "+"s or
"-"s, just as you did with the pitch symbols. For example type:

<ul></ul><!--#[style=Computer]#-->E K O - - E K O - - E K O - - E K O + + + + + + E K O
RETURN

<p>The volume will remain modified until it is explicitly
changed again using the "+" or "-" commands. When TEXTALKER or SPEAKEASY
is first RUN, the volume is already set at about the maximum level.
Increasing the volume one level above this will increase the volume of
fricatives without a corresponding increase in the voiced sounds.

<ul><li>PAUSES

</ul><p>The SPEAKEASY program ignores spaces between
words although we recommend that you type them for better legibility. To
make SPEAKEASY pause, use a comma. The comma may be followed by a number
to vary the length of the pause. A 1 is a short pause while a 9 gives a
long pause. Type in this demonstration:

<ul><li>E K O E K O , 1 E K O , 3 E K O , 5 E K O , 7 E K O , 9
E K O E K O RETURN

</ul><p>If no number is used, a value of 2 is assumed.
Try:

<ul><li>E K O , E K O , 2 E K O RETURN

</ul><p>The pauses between the words are identical.

<p>SPEAKEASY is really not difficult to use, though, due
to its high degree of flexibility, you probably feel that there is an
awful lot to remember. Practice by using the sample vocabulary in Appendix
A and also a dictionary, which will help you encode words when used in
conjunction with your reference card. There is also a program on the
diskette called "PHONEME TRANSLATOR". This program will show the phonemes
that TEXTALKER generates when it translates text to speech. FEATURES TO
AID BLIND USERS

<p>Extra commands designed to help the blind user are
contained in both TEXTALKER.RAM and TEXTALKER.BLIND. You will want to use
TEXTALKER.RAM if you own a RAM card; otherwise use TEXTALKER.BLIND. Type:

<ul><li>B R U N T E X T A L K E R . R A M

<li>or

<li>B R U N T E X T A L K E R . B L I N D

<li>After the disk stops spinning, the following message will
be displayed on the screen:

<li>TEXTALKER (TM)

<li>ECHO II SPEECH GENERATOR VERSION 1.3

<li>COPYRIGHT 1981 VISEK,MAGGS,STREET &amp; KORY

</ul><p>Type in the word "PRINT", but do not press
RETURN. Now press the left arrow key ( &lt;- ) a few times. Notice that as
you back up the cursor, the ECHO will pronounce the letters that the arrow
is passing over. Now press the right arrow key ( -&gt; ) a few times. It
also speaks. The right arrow will do this in all versions of TEXTALKER,
but the left arrow speaks only in TEXTALKER.RAM and TEXTALKER.BLIND. Only
the characters normally pronounced in the punctuation mode currently set
will be spoken.

<ul><li>MODES

</ul><p>LINE REVIEW MODE: provides a controllable audio
cursor. You may move this invisible cursor around the screen to review
what is currently on the screen. To explore this, first type:

<ul><li>H O M E

</ul><p>This is an APPLESOFT command which clears the
screen. Now type:

<ul><li>C A T A L O G

</ul><p>Since TEXTALKER begins in the "Both" mode, the
catalog will be both spoken and printed to the screen. To review the
catalog which is now on the screen you must first type in the Line Review
command:

<ul><li>CTRL/L

</ul><p>The ECHO responded to this command by saying
"review." It is now expecting Line Review commands. When you first enter
Line Review mode you may enter any of the following commands (but do not
type anything yet).

<p>Any letter from A through X: Typing one of these
letters will cause the audio cursor to be positioned at the beginning of
the line which numerically corresponds to the letter selected. Pressing
the letter "A" will position the cursor at the beginning of the first
line. Pressing "B" will place it at the beginning of the second line, and
so on to the twenty-fourth line (X).

<p>Z : Pressing Z will place the audio cursor at the same
vertical and horizontal position as the normal video cursor.

<p>SPACE BAR: Pressing the Space Bar will cause the ECHO
to tell you the current vertical and horizontal position of the cursor. It
will then exit line review mode.

<p>A Control Character: Typing a Control character will
change the command used to enter Line Review mode. This procedure is
identical to that used to change the Control-E command in TEXTALKER.

<p>Now press the Space Bar. The ECHO responded by saying
a letter, corresponding to the vertical position of the cursor, and then
two numbers, which correspond to the horizontal position of the cursor.
The leftmost position is zero. To reenter the Line Review mode type:

<ul><li>CTRL/L

</ul><p>and then...

<p>D

<p>The ECHO confirmed your choice by saying "Line D."
There are now several new commands available to you. You may find it
helpful to use your reference card as we explain them to you.

<p>Press the right arrow twice:

<ul><li>-&gt; -&gt;

</ul><p>Please remember that commands in Line Review mode
should not be followed by pressing RETURN.

<p>The ECHO just said "disk volume." Now press the left
arrow once:

<ul><li>&lt;-

</ul><p>The ECHO said "volume." (The last word it had
spoken.) Now type:

<ul><li>T

<li>and

<li>-&gt; -&gt; -&gt;

</ul><p>The ECHO said the letters "v," "o" and "l." What
did we just do? When you first entered Line Review mode you were also in
Word mode; that is, pressing the arrow keys moved the cursor right or left
by one word at a time. Pressing the letter "T" allows you to Toggle
between (switch between) Word mode and Letter mode. In Letter mode the
cursor moves letter by letter. Press "T" again. You are now back in Word
mode. Press the arrow keys and check if you are not convinced. Now return
the cursor to the beginning of the line, using the &lt;- key, and press:

<ul><li>RETURN

</ul><p>The ECHO said "Disk Volume 254." This is because
pressing the RETURN key causes the ECHO to speak the entire line, starting
from its current position. When it finishes speaking the line, the cursor
will be back at the leftmost position of the same line.

<p>To move the cursor from line to line type:

<ul><li>;

</ul><p>and you will move up one line. To move down one
line type:

<ul><li>/

</ul><p>When moving up and down the cursor will always
move to the beginning of the new line. Try moving to line F (the fifth
line) and experiment with these new commands on the first catalog entry.
Now move back to line C and type a comma:

<ul><li>,

</ul><p>The ECHO will say "to" and wait for you to
indicate up to what line you would like it to read. You will respond with
a letter corresponding to a line number greater than (further along in the
text than) the current line. For example press:

<ul><li>G

</ul><p>The ECHO will now read lines C through G to you.

<p>Finally, pressing:

<ul><li>ESC

</ul><p>will exit Line Review Mode, leaving you exactly
where you were before you entered it. Since Line Review mode exits with
all APPLESOFT variables and pointers intact, you may enter Line Review
mode any time a program prompts you for a answer. Simply type:

<ul><li>CTRL/L

</ul><p>then review the screen using the appropriate
commands and exit Review mode before answering the question.

<ul><li>TECHNICAL or ADVANCED INFORMATION

</ul><p>The heart of the ECHO Two is Texas Instruments'
TMS 5200 speech processor. This circuit is an upgraded version of the one
used in the Speak &amp; Spell (trademark of Texas Instruments) which
models the human vocal tract using LPC (Linear Predictive Coding). Instead
of storing the actual speech signal, only those parameters needed to
describe each speech sound are stored. This accounts for the compactness
of the TEXTALKER system, which takes up no more memory than a HIRES page.

<p>TEXTALKER uses nearly 400 rules of pronunciation and
many common exceptions to these rules to analyze a word. After analyzing
the word, TEXTALKER generates the standard SPEAKEASY phoneme and pitch
codes. TEXTALKER then sends these codes to SPEAKEASY which actually
pronounces the word. TEXTALKER is ,therefore, just a simpler way for the
user to access SPEAKEASY. You may see the actual codes that TEXTALKER
generates by running the PHONEME TRANSLATOR program that you will find on
your TEXTALKER MASTER disk.

<ul><li>TEXTALKER AND PR#0

</ul><p>If you type PR#0 when TEXTALKER is installed,
TEXTALKER actually does the equivalent of a PR#0 and an IN#0. Therefere,
any device previously activated by a IN#n will be disconected.

<ul><li>USING TEXTALKER AND SPEAKEASY FROM MACHINE LANGUAGE

</ul><p>To use TEXTALKER when programming in machine
language simply do a JSR to "COUT" ($FDED) putting the character to be
sent into the accumulator. For example, the following program will result
in the ECHO saying "HI."

<ul><li>A9 C8 LDA #$C8 ;"H"

<li>20 ED FD JSR $FDED ;COUT

<li>A9 C9 LDA #$C9 ;"I"

<li>20 ED FD JSR $FDED ;COUT

<li>A9 8D LDA #$8D ;[RETURN]
<li>20 ED FD JSR $FDED ;COUT

<li>60 RTS ;DONE

</ul><p>SPEAKEASY is accessed similarly except that that
all phoneme strings must begin with a Control-V ($96) and end with a
RETURN ($8D). For example, to say "HI" you would write the following
routine:

<ul><li>A9 96 LDA #$96 ;CTRL-V

<li>20 ED FD JSR $FDED ;COUT

<li>A9 C8 LDA #$C8 ;"H"

<li>20 ED FD JSR $FDED

<li>A9 A1 LDA #$A1 ;"!"

</ul><h2>CHANGING THE FREQUENCY</h2>
<p>All ECHOs are set at the factory to speak at the same
pitch and rate of speed. However, you may modify this by adjusting the
frequency potentiometer (pot) on the ECHO. Adjusting this pot will modify
both the pitch and rate of speech. A higher frequency will cause the ECHO
to speak faster and with a higher pitch. Lowering the frequency will do
the opposite. The pot is in the upper left hand corner of the ECHO, under
the word ECHO and above the word "FREQ". Before you make any adjustments,
you should do two things: first, turn off the power; second, you should
make a small mark on the pot so you will be able to return it to its
original position if you desire. Now, insert a small screwdriver in the
slot on the pot, and turn it counter clockwise to lower the frequency and
clockwise to increase the frequency.

<ul><li>SPEAKEASY PHONEME CATEGORIES

</ul><p>The types of sounds represented by the phoneme
codes are divided into six categories. A brief description of each
category follows. (It is NOT necessary that you understand these
definitions for you to be able to use SPEAKEASY. These brief explanations
are provided for your personal enrichment.)

<p>VOWELS: In pronouncing vowels the air flows
uninterrupted though the vocal cords and lips. (The English vowels are
a,e,i,o and u.)

<p>DIPHTHONGS: These are the combination of two vowel
sounds within one syllable. (Commonly there is only one vowel per
syllable.) To get a feel for this phenomenon, say the word "cake" very
slowly and listen to how the "long a" sound moves into a "y" sound before
the final "k."

<p>"R" COLORED VOWELS: The "r" following these vowels
modifies the sound of the vowel.

<p>VOICED CONSONANTS and UNVOICED FRICATIVES: Each of the
voiced consonants is created by vibrating your vocal cords. Place your
fingertips against your adam's apple and say the voiced consonant
"zzzzzzzzzz." The sensation you feel with your fingertips is the vibration
of the vocal cords. Contrast this with with the lack of sensation which
should result when you say the unvoiced fricative "sssssssssss." The "s"
sound is not produced by vibrating the vocal cords, but through friction,
produced as air flows over various parts of the vocal tract.

<p>STOP CONSONANTS: The flow of air is completely cut off
before we pronounce a stop consonant. Say the word "tall." Because the "l"
is not a stop consonant, we flow smoothly from the "a" sound to the "l"
sound. Now say "tab." "B" is a stop consonant and you will find that you
actually pause, very briefly, before you pronounce the "b."

<ul><li>USING THE ECHO Two WITH COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS

</ul><p>You may use TEXTALKER to make some programs speak
which were not explicitly designed to run with a speech synthesizer. You
would do this by running a TEXTALKER program before running your program.
However, there are limitations:

<ul><li>(1) You must be able to run your program without
booting another diskette. The reason for this is that the TEXTALKER
programs modify DOS when they are first run. If you boot another diskette
you replace the modified DOS with a new DOS.

<li>(2) For similar reasons, your program must not modify DOS
when it runs.

<li>(3) If your program resets memory pointers (i.e. HIMEM,
LOMEM), or requires more than 30K of memory, you will need to use
TEXTALKER.RAM.

<li>APPENDIX B

<li>USING THE ECHO TO ANSWER A TELEPHONE WITH AN APPLE-CAT
MODEM

</ul><p>The ECHO may be used in conjunction with a modem
with "automatic answer" capability, to enable you to receive information
over the telephone. It can even be used this way as a telephone answering
machine. We are including a listing of a sample program which uses the
ECHO Two and an Apple-Cat (TM of Novation Inc.) modem with the Touch Tone
(TM of the Bell System) decoding option.

<p>This program allows you to telephone your Apple
computer and to check and modify an itemized inventory. By following the
instructions included with the Apple-Cat modem, you could also develop the
capability of storing voice messages on a tape recorder like an answering
machine.

<p>Our sample program does the following things. First,
when you call your Apple, the modem will answer the phone. The ECHO will
then ask you for a password, and then an inventory item number. You
respond to these prompts by simply typing in the numbers on any Touch Tone
telephone. The modem will decode the Touch Tones and make them available
to the program, which will send them to the ECHO to be spoken.

<p>The program has quite a few remark statements, which
should help you follow and better understand its logic.

<p>You connect the ECHO to the Apple-Cat as follows:

<p>1. Purchase a cable which has a mini-jack on one end,
and stripped wires on the other end. Radio Shack sells one as part number
42-2434.

<ul><li>2. Plug the mini-jack into the ECHO.

</ul><p>3. Connect the stripped ends of the cable to the
Apple-Cat so that the wire which corresponds to the tip of the cable
(positive) is connected to pin 24 of the interface pins on the Apple-Cat.
The other wire (negative) must be connected to pin 25. If you are unable
to purchase a connector to fit on these pins, you will have to solder the
connection. Soldering may, however, void your Apple-Cat warranty - check
with Novation.
