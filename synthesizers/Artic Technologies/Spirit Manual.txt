INTRODUCTION

Artic hardware speech synthesizer products have been a popular choice
for use with screen reading programs since the first model was introduced
in 1984.  Since then many changes and new models have been developed for
different needs and a variety of computer interfaces. Artic speech has
become well known for it's crisp and highly responsive sound.  Performance
demanding users often prefer Artic speech even over much more expensive
devices.

SPIRIT was developed primarily for the needs of people using computers with
screen reader programs.  It was the evolution of Artic's  popular
Text-to-Speech translators that resulted in low cost SPIRIT.  Unlike some
low cost synthesizers which use coarse sounding snapshots of sampled human
speech, SPIRIT has a TRUE phoneme speech synthesis chip which can blend
phonemes into millions of smooth flowing vocal sounds that would be
impractical with a snapshot approach.

FEATURES

* Performance Advantage of Artic Hardware Synthesizer Responsiveness.
* Priced like a Software Synthesizer.
* Sturdy Aluminum Case is more durable than plastic.
* Smooth Phoneme Chip Blending without warble & chop.
* TransPort & Accent SA command compatible.
* Supports all brands of Screen Access Products.
* Speech Indexing for reading programs. Large input buffer avoids bog downs.
* Removable Data Cable with standard DB9 connector. 
* NiCad battery option saves hundreds of dollars vs disposable 9V batteries.
* 1 pound without NiCad battery, 1.25 pounds with battery.
* 5.8 inches wide by 5.3 inches deep by 1.3 inches high.

SET UP 

Place SPIRIT in a comfortable position near your computer.  Plug the supplied
AC power adapter into the wall and then the jack located on the back of
SPIRIT.  Also on the back of SPIRIT you will notice two data connectors.
The larger 25 pin connector is for factory programming only.  The smaller
DB9 connector is the RS-232 COM port.  Plug the data cable into the SPIRIT
DB9 connector and your computer COM port on the other side.   

POWER UP AND VOLUME 

Rotate the thumb wheel volume control on the front of SPIRIT to turn it on.
Adjust the volume to about the half level.  In a couple of seconds you will
hear the SPIRIT power up message.  You are now ready for a screen reader or
other speech application programs.

OPTIONAL BATTERY OPERATION (Model 600B only)

The SPIRIT 600B includes rechargeable NiCad batteries which over time will
save you hundreds of dollars over the disposable alkaline batteries used by
other synthesizers.  The NiCad batteries will automatically charge when the
AC adapter is plugged in.  Please allow the batteries to charge overnight
for the next day.
NOTE: NiCads can develop a memory effect if left charging all of the time
      over a long period.  This reduces run time.  Let your batteries run
      down on a regular basis for the best efficiency.


POWER-UP COM PORT SETTINGS 

When SPIRIT is first turned on it's COM port is set to the industry standard:
  BAUD RATE:  9600 
  DATA BITS:  8
  PARITY:     NONE
  STOP BITs:  1
All Artic Screen Reading programs automatically detect SPIRIT and set the PC
COM port to match these settings.

CHANGING COM PORT SETTINGS 

If your particular screen reader requires a port setting different from the
SPIRIT default and it does not have the ability to automatically change the
port setting, then you can use the Artic TPSET command (found on the SPIRIT
disk) described below.

TPSET COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:  

/D = Default, 9600 BAUD, No PARITY, 8 DATA , 1 STOP bit. 

/Bn sets the BAUD rate, where n = a number from 0 to 8 
representing a specific baud rate as follows. 
  0 = 110
  1 = 150
  2 = 300
  3 = 600   
  4 = 1200
  5 = 2400
  6 = 4800
  7 = 9600 (DEFAULT)
  8 = 19200 

/Pn sets the PARITY mode where n is a number from 0 - 2 as follows:
  0 = no parity
  1 = odd parity
  2 = even parity

/Ln sets the character LENGTH where n is the number of bits (7 or 8).

/Sn sets the number of STOP bits where n is 1 or 2.

ACCENT SA DEFAULT EXAMPLE:

The TPSET command below sets SPIRIT to match the factory settings for the
ACCENT SA of 9600 baud, no parity, 7 data bits, and 1 stop bit.

TPSET /B7 /P0 /L7 /S1


TPSET ONLINE HELP:
Typing TPSET followed by a return displays a help screen that lists the
parameters.


AUTOEXEC.BAT FOR CHANGING COM PORT AT POWER-UP:

If you wish to change the SPIRIT port setting on every time you turn your
computer on then you can add then TPSET commands above to your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file. 


AUTOMATIC POWER SAVING MODE:

After a few seconds of not speaking SPIRIT will automatically enter a power
reduction mode.  You will hear a faint click from the audio amplifier when
this happens.  This mode is ended once you start to speak again

SPIRIT (TRANSPORT) COMMAND STRINGS:

This information is for program developers that need to control the
synthesizer.
NOTE: All text that is not embedded in a command string will be spoken when
      followed by a space or control code.  Both TransPort and Accent SA
      command strings are supported. 

Speech Characteristic Commands.
CONTROL-E R ?  =  Set Speech Rate, where ? is a number from 0 to 9.
CONTROL-E P ?  =  Set Speech Pitch, where ? is a number from 0 to 9. 
CONTROL-E V ?  =  Set Speech Volume, where ? is a the number from 0 to 9. 
CONTROL-E T ?  =  Set Speech Tone, where ? is a letter from A to Z. 
CONTROL-E N ?  =  Set Number Processor, OFF (? = 0),  ON (? = 1). 
CONTROL-E F ?  =  Set Flat Pitch. OFF (? = 0),  ON (? = 1). 
CONTROL-E S ?  =  Set Spelling. OFF (? = 0),  ON (? = 1). 

Speech Flow Controls.
CONTROL-X      =  Abort speech and be quiet (Instant Flush). 
CONTROL-E H ?  =  Set Host Timeout, where ? is a number from 0 to 9. 
CONTROL-E I ?  =  Set Speech Index Marker, where ? is a letter from A to Z. 
CONTROL-E Q    =  Query Speech Index Marker. 
CONTROL-E W    =  Wait for Speech to complete. 

NOTE: To get a response when a certain point in the text string is reached,
      use a WAIT followed by a QUERY.  For example, the string 
       <"hello": CONTROL-E W CONTROL-E Q>
      sends back an index marker after "hello" speaks.

Miscellaneous Controls.
CONTROL-E $    =  Reset TransPort. 
CONTROL-A P    =  Read Turbo Port. 

Auxiliary Commands.

SPIRIT is compatible with Accent SA commands. However, Accent SA defaults
are slightly different.  Programs should send an Accent Reset command to
get those defaults. 

OTHER ARTIC SYNTHESIZER PRODUCTS
 
Artic has a broad family of portable serial port synthesizers called
TransPort as well as a family of combination synthesizer notetakers for
BRAILLE and QWERTY.
