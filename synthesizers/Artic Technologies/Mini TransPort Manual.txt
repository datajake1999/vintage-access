INTRODUCTION.

Congratulations, you own Artic Technologies' latest and most 
advanced external speech synthesizer, the Artic Mini TransPort.  
However, you are about to discover that it's much more than a simple 
speech synthesizer.

Have you ever had to go away for the weekend, with no room for a 
computer, but you must review a document for work?  Simply load the 
document into Mini TransPort, and study it in the car, on the plane, or 
in a rowboat.  Mini TransPort reads it to you anywhere, anytime. Our 
smallest multi-purpose external speech synthesizer allows you to store 
important files and read them in the same way you would read a book.  
Mini TransPort allows you to store PAL (Personal Appointment Look-
up) files in its internal ROM.  That's not all.  Mini TransPort can turn 
any IBM compatible or laptop computer with a serial port into a 
completely accessible work station using Artic Technologies' powerful 
and featured-filled screen readers (Business Vision for DOS and 
WinVision2 for Microsoft Windows).  Alternatively, you may use any 
screen reading program that supports the SynPhonix or Accent 
command set.

Mini TransPort allows you to set alarms with customized messages to 
remind you of important meetings, daily events such as lunch and 
television shows, or anything else that is important.  It will also read 
personally created reminder files to help you keep track of important 
events in your day.

Mini TransPort has a fully adjustable voice and keeps an accurate 
clock/calendar.  It has a low battery alarm, user replaceable battery 
pack, backup batteries to maintain stored files in memory during 
battery pack switching and user upgradeable firmware via a diskette.  
The Mini TransPort also has PAL files such as a phone list, address 
book, and a To-Do list to help you organize your day-to-day living. 

No bigger than a small paperback book, your new Mini TransPort is 
lightweight (13 ounces), small enough to easily fit in a coat pocket and 
works anywhere you do.  Mini TransPort operates on batteries or 
house current, is simple to connect, easy to use and, most importantly, 
has the clarity, speed and responsiveness you expect from Artic 
Technologies speech products.  This manual guides you step-by-step 
through installing and operating Mini TransPort.  If, after reading this 
manual, you still have questions about Mini TransPort, please call our 
Technical Support staff at 1-810-588-1425.  You can reach us from 9 
A.M. to 5 P.M. Eastern Standard Time.  Please be at your computer 
and have Mini TransPort available so we can provide you with 
effective support. 

If you are a current user of Artic Technologies' Business Vision with 
an internal SynPhonix speech card, you need to reinstall Business 
Vision from the disk supplied with your Mini TransPort as described 
in Chapter 1 of this manual or use the automatic Business Vision 
installation procedure outlined in Chapter 3.  This switches you from 
using the internal SynPhonix card to using Mini TransPort as the 
speech access device for your computer.

========================================================================
CHAPTER 1:   Getting Started

* A.  Unpacking Mini TransPort.

Before using Mini TransPort for the first time, take a 
moment to check the contents of your package to make sure 
that everything is there and undamaged.  The following 
items should be present at the time you unpack the unit:

One Mini TransPort synthesizer.
One Mini TransPort disk containing the MINICOM 
Utility and Business Vision (depending on the model 
of Mini TransPort you purchased)
One external speaker.
One pair of Headphones.
One A-C adapter.
One serial cable with one DB9 male and one DB9 female connector.
One DB9 male to DB25 female adapter.

If you notice any damage or problems with your equipment, 
please contact Artic Technologies immediately.  Our staff is 
ready to help you resolve these problems.

* B.  Touring Mini TransPort.

Take some time to familiarize yourself with Mini TransPort, 
its keypad, jacks and ports.  Once you know where things 
are located, you can easily connect Mini TransPort to your 
computer and use it.

** 1.  Dimensions.

Mini TransPort is approximately 1 inch high by 4.25 inches 
wide by 5.18 inches long.  Mini TransPort easily fits in your 
coat pocket.  Its light weight and rugged construction 
serves you at home, at work or on the road.

** 2.  Physical Characteristics/Appearance.

Let's take a closer look at Mini TransPort.  To begin, take 
Mini TransPort out of the box and set it on a table, rubber 
feet down, controls facing you.  Place your hand on the top 
of the unit.

Mini TransPort is housed in a black aluminum case.  The 
labels for its controls and ports are in gold lettering.  Mini 
TransPort's cover has holes over the internal speaker to 
enhance its sound.

** 3.  The Keypad.

The first thing you notice when exploring the top surface of 
Mini TransPort is its keypad.  It consists of a single row of 
five keys located just above Mini TransPort's front edge.  
They are label, from left to right, ESCAPE, UP ARROW, 
DOWN ARROW, ENTER, and MODE.

** 4.  Resetting Mini TransPort.

In most cases you should not have to reset Mini TransPort.  
However, if the need arises, simply disconnect the A-C 
adapter and pull the battery pack.  Wait about ten seconds, 
then reattach the battery pack and ac adapter.  This will 
automatically reset Mini TransPort to its default state.

** 5.  The Speaker/Headphone Jack.

On the front panel near the right end is a headphone or 
speaker jack to connect Mini TransPort to an external 
speaker or headphones.  When used with an external 
speaker or headphones, the internal speaker is automatically 
disconnected.  You should use a speaker or headphones 
with a 1/8 inch stereo mini plug to connect to this jack.

** 6.  The A-C Adapter. 

On the back panel of Mini TransPort at the right end is the 
connector for the A-C power adapter.  It is larger in 
diameter than the earphone jack, making it easy to identify.  
We supply an A-C power adapter that connects to the jack 
on the back of Mini TransPort.

DO NOT USE AN A-C POWER ADAPTER OTHER 
THAN THE ONE SUPPLIED WITH MINI TRANSPORT.  
YOU MAY RISK DAMAGING MINI TRANSPORT OR 
INADEQUATELY CHARGING ITS BATTERIES.

** 7.  The Serial Port.

To the left of the A-C adapter is a small oblong female port.  
This is Mini TransPort's serial port where you connect the 
serial cable that links Mini TransPort to your computer.  

** 8.  The Battery Pack.

To the left of the serial port is a large slot for the USER 
REPLACEABLE BATTERY PACK.  When installed, the 
battery pack protrudes slightly from Mini TransPort making 
it easy to grab when removing or replacing it.

*** a.  Installing the User Replaceable Battery Pack.

Let's examine the battery pack supplied with Mini 
TransPort.  It is a large rectangle that slides into the back of 
the unit.  If you run your finger over the two short ends of 
the battery pack, you will find that one of them has a 
connector that is almost flush with the surface.  This is the 
end that goes into the slot on Mini TransPort.  Examine the 
flat surfaces on either side of the connector.  You will find 
that one of the flat surfaces has a slight cutout at the 
connector.  This is the top side of the battery pack.  On 
newer battery packs, you will also find a raised dot on the 
top side of the battery pack in the corner opposite the 
connector.

To install the battery pack, grasp it top side up, with the 
connector facing Mini TransPort's Battery Pack slot.  Slide 
the pack into Mini TransPort's Battery Pack slot.  Make 
sure it is firmly in the slot and pushed in as far as it can go.  
You do not need to use excessive force to install the battery pack.

* C.  Installing Mini TransPort.

Now that you know something about how Mini TransPort 
looks, let's learn how to connect it to a computer.  We will 
discuss how to use Business Vision with Mini TransPort 
later in this chapter.

** 1.  Connecting Mini TransPort to a Computer.

Mini TransPort connects to any computer that has a serial 
port via a serial cable.  We provide a serial cable that 
connects Mini TransPort to IBM PC's and compatibles.  It 
has a 9 pin male connector that attaches to Mini TransPort, 
and a 9 pin female connector that attaches to the 9 pin male 
serial port on your computer.

If you want to connect the serial cable to a 25 pin male 
serial port found on older IBM-compatible computers, plug 
the 9 pin female connector into the serial cable adapter 
included with Mini TransPort.  If you are using another 
computer that requires a different cable, contact Artic 
Technologies for assistance.

Once you select a serial port, perform the following steps: 

1.  Plug the 9 pin male connector into the 9 pin female 
    serial port on the back panel of Mini TransPort.  Make 
    sure the connector is oriented in the right direction and 
    lined up properly so that you avoid bending the pins.  
    You can orient yourself by examining the connector 
    cover that surrounds the pins on the male end of the 
    serial cable.  The connector cover is like a lop-sided 
    rectangle, with two long sides and two short sides.  
    The two short sides slope slightly making one long 
    side longer than the other.  The same is true for the 
    female connector on Mini TransPort.  The longer of 
    the two long sides is on the top.  Plug the cable into 
    the unit with the longer of the two long sides facing 
    up.  The cable fits snugly, but do not use excessive 
    force when pushing the serial cable into the connector 
    on Mini TransPort.  If you cannot get the cable to fit, 
    turn it over and try again.

2.  Plug the 9 pin (or 25 pin if adapted) female end of the 
    cable into the serial port on your computer.  The same 
    rectangular sloping configuration exists on your 
    computer regardless of the connector size. 

** 2.  Connecting the A-C Adapter.

Mini TransPort operates on household current (AC) or on 
its Nickel-Cadmium battery pack.

NOTE:  do not operate Mini TransPort on the battery 
pack until it is fully charged.  We will discuss charging 
Mini TransPort's batteries in the next section.

To connect Mini TransPort to the A-C adapter: 

1.  Insert the metal connector into the jack on the back 
    panel of your unit. 
2.  Plug the other end of the adapter into a wall outlet. 

The A-C adapter serves 2 purposes.  It powers Mini 
TransPort and it charges the Nickel-Cadmium battery pack.  
Do not worry about over-charging the batteries.  Mini 
TransPort's design prevents this from happening.

** 3.  Using Mini TransPort's Batteries.

You must fully charge Mini TransPort's batteries before 
using them for the first time.  It takes about twelve hours to 
completely charge its batteries.  Once charged, Mini 
TransPort operates approximately 8 hours.  This estimate 
varies due to the amount of time Mini TransPort speaks and 
how high you set the volume.

If you use other appliances with rechargeable batteries, you 
know that proper use and charging of batteries extends their 
working life.  We suggest that you operate Mini TransPort 
on batteries until they are completely discharged.  If you 
charge the batteries before they are dead, you risk 
developing Battery Memory.  This condition causes 
batteries to hold less charge then it would normally. To 
avoid this problem, fully discharge the battery before 
recharging it.  See Battery-Drain Mode under the Options 
menu in Chapter 3 for a quick discharge procedure.  Repeat 
this procedure for a few cycles if you experience short 
battery life.  Your batteries should begin to bounce back 
after a while.  If not, contact Artic Technologies.

Mini TransPort has a built in battery check option that tells 
you when it's time to charge the batteries.  This feature is 
explained in Chapter 3 (under the Options Menu).

*** a.  Power Saving Modes.

Mini TransPort has two modes that conserve battery use.  
They are IDLE MODE POWER SAVER and AUTO-STANDBY.  IDLE MODE 
POWER SAVER automatically shuts down Mini TransPort's audio 
amplifier after a short period of inactivity.  You may hear 
a slight clicking sound confirming that IDLE MODE POWER SAVER 
is active and has powered down the audio amplifier.  Any 
keystroke automatically wakes Mini TransPort up causing it to 
speak.

AUTO-STANDBY occurs when Mini TransPort remains 
inactive for approximately one hour.  In this mode, Mini 
TransPort powers down and ignores all input.  You must 
turn Mini TransPort on to wake it up. 

NOTE:  The power saving modes only apply when 
operating Mini TransPort from the internal batteries.  
When connected to an adapter, these modes are disabled.

** 4.  Powering Up Mini TransPort.

You learned how to connect Mini TransPort to a computer 
and operate it on A-C current or batteries.  Now lets turn 
Mini TransPort on and start using it.  To start:

1.  Put Mini TransPort in front of you on a desk (table).
2.  With your hands on the keypad, find the second and 
    fourth keys from left to right on the keypad.  They are 
    labeled Up Arrow and Enter.
3.  Press both keys together and hold them down until you 
    hear a beep, then release them.  You will hear the 
    message:
	MINI TRANSPORT
    This confirms that Mini TransPort is on and ready for 
    operation.  Mini TransPort has different models that 
    reflect the presence or absence of various software 
    options.  Please read Appendix C for more information 
    concerning the different models and their definitions.  
    If you do not hear the power up message, make sure 
    the A-C adapter are plugged snugly into the wall outlet 
    and into Mini TransPort. If you still do not hear 
    anything, contact Artic Technologies for assistance. 

To turn Mini TransPort off, hold down the second and 
fourth keys (the same keys used to turn it on).  You will 
hear the message:
	TURNING OFF
This is a toggle, meaning that the same keys are used to  
switch back and forth between two states (in this case, ON 
and OFF).

Once you hear Mini TransPort's greeting, you are ready to 
select an option from its menu.

The next chapter discusses these menus in detail.

** 5.  Controlling Mini TransPort with Business Vision.

Now let's look at how to use Business Vision with Mini 
TransPort.

Like internal synthesizer boards, external speech 
synthesizers do not know what to speak on their own.  They 
need programs to control what they speak.  

*** a.  Installing Business Vision.

All Mini TransPort models work with the Artic Business 
Vision screen access program.  If you own a copy of 
Business Vision that supports Mini TransPort, you should 
read this section to help you get started.  If not, skip the rest 
of this chapter.

With Mini TransPort ON and the supplied serial cable 
attached to your computer and the unit, perform the 
following steps:

1.  Place the Business Vision diskette supplied with Mini 
    TransPort into the floppy drive on your computer 
    (normally drive A).
2.  Change to the drive that contains your Business Vision 
    diskette.  For example, if your disk is in drive A, type:
	A:
    followed by the ENTER key.
3.  Type INSTALL, followed by the drive where you want 
    Business Vision to go, followed by a colon, followed 
    by two ENTER keys.  For example:
	INSTALL C:
    followed by two ENTER keys (hit the enter key twice) 
    This installs Business Vision on drive C.  If you want 
    to install Business Vision on a floppy drive, see 
    Chapter 1 of your Business Vision manual. 

There is a way to transfer Business Vision or a screen 
reader of your choice from Mini TransPort to your 
computer without using a disk.  You will learn about this in 
Chapter 3's discussion of Mini TransPort's Options menu.

*** b.  Starting Business Vision.

To start Business Vision, perform the following steps:
1.  Go to the drive where you installed Business Vision.  
    If drive C is the drive that contains Business Vision, 
    type: 
	C:
    followed by the ENTER key.
2.  Now go to the root directory by typing: 
	CD\
    followed by the ENTER key.
3.  Type one of the following commands: 
	TV1
    followed by the ENTER key to start Business Vision 
    with Mini TransPort attached to COM1.

The commands TV2, TV3, and TV4 start Business 
Vision with Mini TransPort attached to COM port 2, 
3, or 4 respectively.

If you want Business Vision to start up each time you turn 
ON your computer, add the following statement to your 
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

	CALL TV1

Here is the contents of the TV1.BAT file with a brief 
explanation:

    TVISION /M3 /C1
    
TVISION.COM is Mini TransPort's version of Artic 
Business Vision.  Remember, it is not necessary to 
specify the extension of a program to start it.  
Therefore, TVISION starts the Business Vision 
program for Mini TransPort using COM1 (/C1).

NOTE:  some users familiar with SynPhonix speech 
cards may wonder why VEST.COM is not loaded 
before running TVISION.COM.  This is because 
VEST.COM is a permanent part of Mini TransPort 
and starts every time you turn it ON.  

/M3  is a command line switch that disables the 
Memory Miser in Business Vision.  This is the 
recommended setting to use unless you need to 
conserve memory.  For more information on Memory 
Miser, consult Chapter 1 of your Business Vision 
manual.

/C1, /C2, /C3, or /C4  chooses the communications 
port for Business Vision.  The number following the 
letter C corresponds to the appropriate COM port.  
For example, to instruct Business Vision to use COM 
1 use /C1.

NOTE:  if you do not specify a COM port, Business 
Vision defaults to COM1 (/C1). 

If you successfully start Business Vision, you will hear a 
message, something like the following, spoken: 

	ARTIC BUSINESS VISION  VERSION 3.09.

This is followed by the copyright message.

If you do not hear this message, check to see if Mini 
TransPort is connected to the right COM port.  If you chose 
the wrong COM port, restart your computer by pressing the 
reset button or by simultaneously pressing the CONTROL, 
ALT  and DELETE keys and then releasing them. 

Restart Business Vision with the batch file that corresponds 
to the right COM port.  If this fails, check your serial 
connections and cable.  Make sure that Mini TransPort is 
connected and turned ON.  If you are still having trouble, 
contact Artic Technologies for help.

Once Business Vision is active, you will likely be in drive C 
at the \ARTIC\VISION subdirectory.  Business Vision and 
WinVision (our Windows screen review software) control 
Mini TransPort in the same manner as they control our 
other synthesizers.  If the Volume of Mini TransPort is too 
loud or too soft, or you do not like the Pitch or Tone, you 
can control these options.  These voice parameters can be 
changed using Mini TransPort's keypad (refer to Chapter 
3), using Business Vision Control Mode options (refer to 
the Business Vision manual) or using the WinVision 
dialogue box (refer to the WinVision manual).  We 
recommend you become familiar with Business Vision and 
WinVision so that you can get the most out of your Mini 
TransPort.  The rest of this manual familiarizes you with 
Mini TransPort and its many features.


========================================================================
CHAPTER 2:   The Menus: Keys To The Program


Mini TransPort has a wealth of features for you to use.  
However, this does not mean that Mini TransPort is difficult 
to operate.  You can access Mini TransPort's many features 
through a cleverly designed menu system controlled by Mini 
TransPort's keypad.

NOTE:  You can access Mini TransPort's menus from 
your computer's keyboard by using a special utility called 
MINICOM.  MINICOM's features are discussed in Chapter 4.

* A.  Getting Acquainted With The Keypad.

As stated earlier, you can use Mini TransPort's five key 
keypad to enter text, choose a menu, leave a menu, set the 
clock and calendar, and so on.  For a small keypad to 
control these functions in a simple yet effective manner, 
Artic Technologies devised a special key called the MODE 
key.  It is the large key on the right end of the keypad.  
Pressing then releasing the MODE key shifts the keypad 
between three control modes called CURSOR, TURBO, 
and VOLUME/TONE.

** 1.  The CURSOR Mode.

In CURSOR Mode (Mini TransPort's default setting) you 
can use the Mini TransPort keys to navigate menus.  When 
the MODE key is not held down, the keypad is in Menu 
Navigation mode.  The four small keys are defined from left 
to right as follows:

KEY 1 = Escape.
KEY 2 = Up Arrow.
KEY 3 = Down Arrow.
KEY 4 = Enter.
KEY 5 = MODE.

When navigating menus, the ESCAPE key exits you from a 
sub-menu and returns you to the previous menu level.  The 
UP and DOWN ARROW keys permit you to scroll through 
menu options.  The ENTER key permits you to choose the 
current menu setting.  

** 2.  The Function Keys.

When the MODE key is depressed, the ESCAPE, UP 
ARROW, DOWN ARROW, and ENTER keys (KEY 1, KEY 2, 
KEY 3, and KEY 4) become general purpose function keys 
labeled from left to right as follows:

FUNCTION KEY A
FUNCTION KEY B
FUNCTION KEY C
FUNCTION KEY D

Each function key has several numbers or letters assigned to 
it to facilitate number and text entry.  A complete list of 
function keys and their values are listed later in this chapter.

** 3.  TURBO Mode.

When Mini TransPort is in TURBO Mode, you can fast 
forward or rewind through previously spoken text stored in 
its speech buffer.  You can also get the current date and 
time as well as determine the model and serial number of 
your Mini TransPort.  

** 4.  VOLUME/TONE Mode.

The VOLUME/TONE Mode permits you to change the 
volume and tone of Mini TransPort.  We will discuss the 
keys used to control these options later in this chapter.

* B.  Number, Cursor, and Turbo Keys.

Now that you know something about Mini TransPort's 
keypad, it's time to learn how to use it to enter numbers and 
letters.  We will discuss how to use the keypad to navigate 
menus in the next chapter.

** 1.  The Number/Cursor Keys.

There will be times when you want to enter numbers or 
letters into Mini TransPort to set the time, set an alarm, or 
write a quick note.  Let's look at how to use the Mini 
TransPort's keypad to enter numbers and letters.

If you hold down the MODE key while repeatedly pressing 
FUNCTION KEYS A, B, C or D, you will hear a series of 
letters, numbers, or symbols that you can enter into Mini 
TransPort.  For example, holding down the MODE key 
while repeatedly pressing FUNCTION KEY A presents the 
following keystroke choices:

MODE Key with FUNCTION KEY A (Key 1)
Backspace, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

To enter the number 3, hold down the MODE key, press 
FUNCTION KEY A until you hear "3" spoken, then release 
the MODE key.  As soon as the MODE key is released, the 
number 3 is entered into Mini TransPort.  All other numbers 
can be entered in this way.

** 2.  Entering Letters.

Entering letters is just as easy as entering numbers.  Holding 
down the MODE key while repeatedly pressing FUNCTION 
KEYS A, B, or C will give you all of the letters of the 
alphabet as well as some special symbols.  To choose a 
letter or symbol, simply hold down the MODE key, press 
the appropriate FUNCTION KEY until you hear the letter or 
symbol, then release the MODE key.  Here is a list of 
FUNCTION KEYS and their associated keystrokes.

MODE Key with FUNCTION KEY B (Key 2)
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J

MODE Key with FUNCTION KEY C (Key 3)
K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T

MODE Key with FUNCTION KEY D (Key 4)
Space, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, Asterisk, Period, Delete

** 3.  The Turbo Keys.

As previously mentioned, pressing the MODE key once 
shifts the keypad from CURSOR to TURBO Mode.  In this 
mode, KEYS 2 and 4 rewind or fast forward through the text 
in the speech buffer.  They perform the same functions as 
Turbo pedals do with our internal speech card.  In TURBO 
Mode, the keys are defined as follows:

KEY 1 = Speak serial number and software version.
KEY 2 = Turbo backward through text.
KEY 3 = Turbo forward through text.
KEY 4 = Speak date and time.
KEY 5 = MODE key.

** 4.  Setting the Volume and Tone.

In VOLUME/TONE Mode, the keys are defined as follows:

KEY 1 = Volume down (decrease volume).
KEY 2 = Volume up (increase volume).
KEY 3 = Tone down, decrease high frequencies.
KEY 4 = Tone up, increase high frequencies.
KEY 5 = MODE key.

Adjust the volume and tone controls until you are satisfied 
with the way Mini TransPort sounds.


========================================================================
CHAPTER 3:   Ordering From The Menu 

* A.  The Main Menu.

Now that you are familiar with Mini TransPort's keypad, 
let's explore its menu system.  The first time you turn Mini 
TransPort ON, you are in its Main Menu.  If you turn the 
unit OFF while in a sub-menu (such as the File Manager) 
you are there when you turn the unit ON again.  Hit 
ESCAPE to return to the Main Menu (KEY 1 in CURSOR 
mode).

** 1.  Using the Arrow Keys to Hear the Choices.

Turn Mini TransPort ON by holding down the UP ARROW 
and ENTER keys (KEYS 2 and 4).  If necessary, press 
ESCAPE to place Mini TransPort in the Main Menu.  Use 
the UP and DOWN ARROW keys (KEYS 2 and 3) to move 
through the menu choices.  As you move down, you will 
hear the menu choices in order:  Voice, Alarms, and so on.  

** 2.  Choosing A Sub-Menu.

Choose sub-menus by using the UP and DOWN ARROW keys 
to find the appropriate one, press ENTER to select it, and 
press ESCAPE when you want to return to the Main Menu.

* B.  The Sub-Menus.

Now let us look at Mini TransPort's features and how they 
serve you.  The sub-menus are the key to Mini TransPort's 
operation.  Let's take a closer look at them.  Study the 
previous sections carefully before continuing.  The material 
covered is referenced frequently.

** 1.  The Voice Menu.

The Voice Menu is the first option under the Setup Menu 
and is used to set Mini TransPort's voice parameters (Rate, 
Pitch, Volume, Tone).  Adjusting these parameters will only 
effect how Mini TransPort's voices speak when going 
through the menus or speaking PAL files.  They do not 
effect how Business Vision or other screen access programs 
speak when using Mini TransPort as a speech synthesizer.  
Screen access programs control their own voice parameters.

Locate the Voice Menu under the Setup Menu using the UP 
and DOWN ARROWS and press ENTER.  Once there, you will 
be placed at the top of a list of voice parameters.  Move 
among these parameters using the UP and DOWN ARROWS.  
Starting from the top, they are:

RATE.
PITCH.
VOLUME.
TONE.
CAPS.
SYMBOLS.

Let's take a closer look at what each parameter does.

*** a.  Speech Rate.

The Rate setting determines how fast or slow Mini 
TransPort's voice speaks.  Use the ARROW keys to go to the 
Rate option.  Press ENTER and you will hear the message:

	USE UP AND DOWN ARROWS TO CHANGE VALUE.  PRESS 
	ENTER TO SELECT OR ESCAPE TO ABORT.

You then hear the current value of the Rate setting.  Use the 
UP and DOWN ARROW keys to scroll through the Rate 
settings, which range from 0 (slowest) to 9 (fastest).  When 
you locate the setting you want, press ENTER to select it 
and return to the Voice Menu.

*** b.  Speech Pitch.

The Pitch setting determines how low or high Mini 
TransPort's voice sounds when speaking.  Use the ARROW 
keys to go to the Pitch option and press ENTER.  Mini 
TransPort prompts: 

	USE UP AND DOWN ARROWS TO CHANGE VALUE.  PRESS 
	ENTER TO SELECT OR ESCAPE TO ABORT.

You then hear the current value of the Pitch setting.  Use 
the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to scroll through the Rate 
settings, which range from 0 (lowest) to 9 (highest).  When 
you locate the setting you want, press ENTER to select it 
and return to the Voice Menu.

*** c.  Speech Volume.

The Volume setting determines how loud or soft Mini 
TransPort's voice speaks.  Use the ARROW keys to go to the 
Volume option and press ENTER.  Mini TransPort prompts:

	USE UP AND DOWN ARROWS TO CHANGE VALUE.  PRESS 
	ENTER TO SELECT OR ESCAPE TO ABORT.

You then hear the current value of the Volume setting.  Use 
the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to scroll through the 
Volume settings, which range from 0 (softest) to 9 
(loudest).  When you locate the setting you want, press  
ENTER to select it and return to the Voice Menu.

*** d.  Speech Tone.

The Tone setting determines how bright or dull Mini 
TransPort's voice sounds when speaking.  Use the ARROW 
keys to go to the Tone option and press ENTER.  Mini 
TransPort prompts:

	USE UP AND DOWN ARROWS TO CHANGE VALUE.  PRESS 
	ENTER TO SELECT OR ESCAPE TO ABORT.

You then hear the current value of the Tone setting.  Use 
the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to scroll through the Tone 
settings, which range from "A" (dullest) to "Z" (brightest).  
When you locate the setting you want, press ENTER to 
select it and return to the Voice Menu.

*** e.  Identify Capital Letters.

This option permits you to determine whether or not capital 
letters are announced when reading information.  Use the 
ARROW keys to go to the Caps option, at which point Mini 
TransPort will inform you of the current Caps setting.  
When you press ENTER to select the option, Mini TransPort 
prompts:

	USE UP AND DOWN ARROWS TO PICK CHOICE.  PRESS 
	ENTER TO SELECT OR PRESS ESCAPE TO ABORT.

Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to scroll through the 
available Caps modes.  The choices are:

OFF:    There is no indication of capitalized letters.
SAY:    Each capitalized letter or word is preceded by 
	the spoken word "CAP".
PITCH:  Each capitalized letter or word is spoken with 
	a temporary increase in Pitch.

Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to scroll through the 
capitalization options.  When you locate the setting you 
want, press ENTER to select it and return to the Voice 
Menu.

*** f.  Speak Symbols.

This option permits you to choose how you want characters 
such as punctuation, math symbols and border characters to 
be handled by Mini TransPort.  Use the ARROW keys to go 
to this option, at which point Mini TransPort will tell you 
the current value of the Symbols setting.  When you press 
ENTER to select the option, Mini TransPort prompts:

	USE UP AND DOWN ARROWS TO PICK CHOICE.  PRESS 
	ENTER TO SELECT OR PRESS ESCAPE TO ABORT.

Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to scroll through the 
available Symbol settings.  They are:

NONE:   No symbols are spoken. 
SOME:   Speak a minimal number of symbols 
MOST:   Speak all symbols except punctuation. 
ALL:    Speak all symbols. 

Use the UP and DOWN ARROWS to locate the appropriate 
mode and press ENTER to select it and return to the Voice 
Menu.

** 2.  Setting Alarms.

The Alarms menu is one of Mini TransPort's most useful 
features.  You can set "one time" alarms with stored 
playback messages, or set daily and/or weekly alarms with 
stored playback messages that trigger on specified dates and 
times.  You can use this feature to remind yourself about 
lunch appointments, important meetings, television shows, 
etc..  Unlike an alarm clock, the stored message reminds 
you why you set the alarm in the first place.

Furthermore, you can save your preset alarms in different 
files.  For example, you might set ten alarms (the maximum 
number in an alarm file) that go off once a week to remind 
you of calls and appointments for work and home.   Then, if 
you have to take a trip, Mini TransPort can be used to keep 
track of your important appointments while you are on the 
road.  You don't have to lose your preset alarms.  Just save 
them to a file before you reset the alarms for your trip.  
Reload the weekly alarm file when you return home.

Here is a quick overview of the Alarm Menu options.  The 
Alarm Menu is the second entry in the Main Menu (after the 
Voice Menu).  Find it with the UP and DOWN ARROW keys.  
Select it with ENTER.  The first time you enter this sub-
menu you are at the top of the menu on the "Set Alarms" 
option.  In order, the Alarm sub-menu choices are:

Set Alarms:     allows you to set one-time, weekly, or daily 
		alarms.
Load Alarms:    allows you to load a file containing 
		previously saved alarm information.
Save Alarms:    allows you to create a file with all of your 
		alarm information for later use.
Check Time:     announces the current date and time.
Set Time:       allows you to set the current date and time.
Clear Alarm:    allows you to clear all alarms from memory.

Now, let's take each choice and see how it works.

*** a.  Set Alarms Menu.

Pressing ENTER on the Set Alarms option takes you to a list 
of ten alarm slots, labeled "A" through "J".  When you enter 
this menu, Mini TransPort prompts:

	UNUSED ALARM A.

Your UP and DOWN ARROWS scroll through the ten slots. 
To set slot A's alarm, scroll to this unused alarm slot (if you 
are not already there) and press ENTER.  Mini TransPort 
prompts:

	EDIT ALARM MENU.  READ MESSAGE.

Press DOWN ARROW to get to the next choice.  Mini 
TransPort prompts:

	EDIT MESSAGE.

Press DOWN ARROW again and Mini TransPort Prompts:

	CHANGE ALARM TIME. 

Use your UP and DOWN ARROW keys to find:

	CHANGE ALARM TIME. 

Hit ENTER to set the date and time.  Mini TransPort 
prompts:

	PICK ALARM TYPE.

Use your UP and DOWN ARROW keys to select one of the 
following options:

ONE TIME.
WEEKLY.
DAILY.

ONE TIME is an alarm that goes off only once at the 
indicated date and time.  WEEKLY is an alarm that goes off 
once a week at the indicated day and time.  DAILY is an 
alarm that goes off once a day at the indicated time.  Use 
your UP and DOWN ARROW keys to select the appropriate 
alarm type and press ENTER.

>>From here, your prompts will vary depending upon the type 
of alarm you select.  If you choose a ONE TIME alarm, 
Mini TransPort prompts:

	ENTER IN THE DATE AS A SET OF THREE TWO-DIGIT 
	NUMBERS WITH A SPACE BETWEEN NUMBERS.

Use the keypad (as described in Chapter 2) to enter 
numbers.  For example, to enter February 19, 1994, hold 
down the MODE key and press FUNCTION KEY A until you 
hear the number 0, then release the MODE key.  Hold down 
the MODE key and press FUNCTION KEY A until you hear 
the number 2, then release the MODE key.  So far, you 
have entered the digits 02 to represent February (the second 
month of the year).  Now you need to enter a "space".  
Hold down the MODE key and press FUNCTION KEY D.  
When you hear the word "SPACE", release the MODE key.  
Continue in this fashion until the month, day, and year are 
successfully entered.  When you have finished entering the 
digits, press ENTER to terminate the string of digits.  
Remember, mistakes are easily erased by accessing the 
"backspace" with the MODE key and FUNCTION KEY A.

If you choose a WEEKLY alarm as your alarm type, Mini 
TransPort skips the date question and prompts:

	CHOOSE THE DAY OF THE WEEK.

Use your UP and DOWN ARROWS to select the day on which 
you want the alarm to go off and press ENTER.

If you choose DAILY as your alarm type, Mini TransPort 
skips the date and day of the week questions and proceeds 
to the alarm time query.  At this point, the prompts for all 
alarm types become the same.  Now Mini TransPort 
prompts:

	ENTER IN THE TIME AS A SET OF 2 TWO-DIGIT NUMBERS 
	WITH A SPACE BETWEEN.

For example, enter 1:35 as "zero, one, space, three, five" 
using the MODE and FUNCTION keys as described previously.  
After you enter the time correctly, press ENTER again and 
Mini TransPort Queries:

	IS THE TIME PM?

If so, press UP ARROW to confirm.  If not, hit DOWN 
ARROW to tell Mini TransPort that the time is A.M..  You 
are now back to the Edit Alarm Menu, Change Alarm Time 
(where you were before you entered the date and time for 
the alarm).

Now hit the UP ARROW to go to the Edit Message menu 
choice and press ENTER to select it.

You can enter a message to be spoken when the alarm goes 
off.  Try something simple like "hello" or your name using 
the letter entry method described in Chapter 2.  When 
finished, hit ENTER to get back to the Edit Alarm menu.

When you return to the Edit Alarm menu, use the UP 
ARROW key to find the top menu choice, "Read Message", 
and hit ENTER.  You should hear the text you typed in, 
followed by Mini TransPort confirming that you are still in 
the Edit Alarm menu and on the Read Message option.

Press ESCAPE to get back to the Set Alarms menu.  Now, 
instead of hearing:

	UNUSED ALARM A.

you should hear:

	02 19 94 SATURDAY 01 35 PM ON. 

If you had hit DOWN ARROW back when you were asked if 
the alarm was P.M., Mini TransPort would speak the date 
and time of the alarm and the word "ON" without saying 
"A.M.".  In other words, A.M. is silent, P.M. is spoken.

The alarm is now set.  It will go off one time, once a week, 
or once a day according to the selected alarm type.  Mini 
TransPort will announce the date, the day of the week, and 
the word ON for a ONE TIME alarm.  For a WEEKLY 
alarm, the day of the week (Sunday, Monday, etc.) and the 
time will be spoken, followed by the word ON.  For a 
DAILY alarm, the time and the word ON will be spoken.  
(Remember, P.M. is spoken, A.M. is not.)

*** b.  Saving Alarms.

You just set an alarm.  Now let's save it.

Press ESCAPE until you return to the Alarm sub-menu.  You 
are still on the Set Alarms option.  Arrow down past Load 
Alarms to the next option which is Save Alarms and press 
ENTER.  Mini TransPort prompts:

	ENTER IN NAME WITH NO EXTENSION FOR ALARM FILE.

Enter a filename eight letters or less with no file extension 
and hit ENTER.  For this example, type the filename:

	MYFILE

and hit ENTER.  You will return to the main Alarm Options 
menu.

*** c.  Deleting Alarms.

>>From the Alarms menu, use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys 
to locate:

	CLEAR ALARMS.

and hit ENTER.  Mini TransPort prompts:

	ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE ALL THE ALARMS?

Press the UP ARROW key to confirm deleting the alarms.  
The alarms are deleted and you will return to the Alarms 
menu.  To avoid clearing the alarms, you may press either 
ESCAPE or the DOWN ARROW key and you will be returned 
to the Alarms menu with all alarms intact.

In this example, you pressed the UP ARROW key to confirm 
deleting the alarms.  Now, go up to the Set Alarms option 
and hit ENTER.  You will hear:

	UNUSED ALARM A.

This is because all of the alarm slots (including the one you 
set earlier) are now empty.

You can delete an individual alarm by going into the Set 
Alarms menu (locate it with the UP and DOWN ARROW keys 
and press ENTER).  Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to 
find the alarm you want to delete.  Once there, hold down 
the MODE key and press FUNCTION KEY D until you reach 
"DELETE".  Release both keys and the alarm is deleted and 
you are returned to the empty alarm slot.

*** d.  Loading Alarms.

Press ESCAPE to go back to the main Alarms menu.  Use 
the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to find the Load Alarms 
menu option and press ENTER to select it.  You are now in 
a menu that lists your alarm files.  There is only one file in 
this list now, and it's the one you just saved:
	
	MYFILE.ALM

The extension ".ALM" was automatically supplied by Mini 
TransPort.  Press ENTER now and the alarm you created 
earlier is instantly loaded into Mini TransPort.  Confirm this 
by using your UP and DOWN ARROW keys to locate the Set 
Alarms menu and press ENTER to select it.  You will find 
that the alarm you previously set is now loaded into the first 
slot.

If there had been more than one alarm file available, you 
would simply have used the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to 
select the desired file and then pressed ENTER to load it.

*** e.  Checking and Setting the Time.

The fourth and fifth entries in the Alarms menu allow you to 
check and set the time and date.

The Check Time function announces the date and time 
when you press ENTER.  Because checking the time is 
something you may do often, Mini TransPort has a special 
Check Time feature that allows you to check the current 
date and time from anywhere without having to enter the 
Alarms menu.

Press the MODE key to place Mini TransPort's keypad in 
TURBO mode and then press FUNCTION KEY D (KEY 4) to 
check the date and time.

The Set Time function prompts you to enter the current 
date and time exactly as in the Edit Alarm menu.  However, 
in this situation you cannot skip the date field.

*** f.  Turning Off Alarms Temporarily.

Suppose you have a daily alarm set to get you up in the 
morning, but you do not want it to go off on the weekend 
and you do not want to go to the trouble of clearing all of 
your alarms.  You want to keep your current alarm file and 
do not wish to load another one.  From the Main menu, use 
the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to find the Alarms menu 
option and select it with ENTER.  Use the UP and DOWN 
ARROW keys to locate the Set Alarms sub-menu and select 
it with ENTER.  You are now in the list of preset alarms.  
Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to find the alarm that 
wakes you up and enter a BACKSPACE (using the MODE 
key and FUNCTION KEY A).  You will now hear that alarm's 
information spoken, but with the word OFF instead of ON.  
All of your alarms may be toggled ON and OFF with the 
BACKSPACE, regardless of their type.

Of course, if you want to wake up on week days, but don't 
want to toggle the Daily alarm off for the weekend, you can 
set five Weekly alarms to go off at the same time, each for a 
different weekday.  By using combinations of Weekly, 
Daily, and One-Time alarms, you can meet all of your 
scheduling needs with Mini TransPort's alarm menu.

*** g.  Responding To Alarms.

Now that you know all about creating and modifying alarms 
... what happens when an alarm actually goes off?

When Mini TransPort's time and date match the time and 
date of an active alarm, Mini TransPort will start to issue a 
series of beeps to alert you.  This beeping will continue until 
you let Mini TransPort know that you've heard the alarm.  
You do this by pressing any of the four FUNCTION keys.  
Once you do that, Mini TransPort stops beeping and says:

	ALARM MESSAGE

followed by the message associated with the alarm (if you 
entered one when you created the alarm).

** 3.  Mini TransPort's File Menu.

Every computing device needs a file management system to 
help the user organize and manipulate files.  Mini 
TransPort's File Menu provides the following functions to 
manage files:

FILTER STRING.
LIST DIRECTORY.
ERASING FILES.
RENAMING FILES.
COPYING FILES.
MEMORY LEFT.
FORMAT USER ROM.

*** a.  The Filter String.

The first File Menu option is Filter String.  By modifying  
this string, you can determine which files get presented  
when you ask for a directory listing.  The default setting for 
the Filter String is *.* (star period star).  Mini TransPort 
will announce this as:

	FILTER STRING STAR STAR.

You will notice that Mini TransPort does not speak the 
period between the two asterisks.  Since this period is 
always present, it is dropped from the speech for efficiency.

Those of you familiar with DOS know that the stars (or 
asterisks) are wildcard characters that literally mean 
"anything".  If you ask for a list of files in a directory, Mini 
TransPort will use the Filter String to decide which files to 
present and which files to ignore.  With the default setting 
of the Filter String, Mini TransPort lists ALL files, looking 
for "anything" as a name or extension.

If you only want to see the files sent to Mini TransPort with 
an extension of ".DOC", use the UP and DOWN ARROW 
keys to find the Filter String option and press ENTER.  Mini 
TransPort prompts:
	
	ENTER IN THE NEW FILTER.

To list files with a DOC extension, use the MODE and 
FUNCTION keys (as described in Chapter 2) to type:
	
	*.DOC

then press the ENTER key.  Mini TransPort responds:
	
	FILTER STRING STAR DOC.

This means that any file function invoked while this Filter 
String is active brings up only those files with the .DOC 
extension.  All other files are ignored until the Filter String 
is changed.

If you only want to see your Alarm files, set the Filter String 
to *.ALM (star dot A L M).

We recommend that you leave the Filter String at *.* (star 
dot star) unless you want to filter out unwanted file names.

*** b.  The List Directory.

The second File Menu option is Directory.  This speaks the 
names of files in the Current Directory and their sizes.  If 
you want to know what files are stored in the user ROM, 
use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to find the List 
Directory option under the File Menu and press ENTER.  
Mini TransPort begins speaking the list of files located in 
the user ROM (within the parameters of the Filter String 
which was explained in the previous section).

While Mini TransPort speaks the list of files, press ENTER.  
Immediately, Mini TransPort will spell the current file name 
making it easier to understand non-standard file naming 
conventions.  Practice this by pressing ENTER again to list 
the files and ENTER to spell file names.

If you press the UP and DOWN ARROW keys while the 
directory is speaking, Mini TransPort stops speaking the list 
of files and allows you to navigate through the file list using 
the ARROW keys.  As you move from file to file, the name 
of the file and its size is announced.  When you are done 
navigating the file list with the ARROW keys, press ESCAPE 
to return to the File Menu.

As files are added, renamed or erased, the directory is  
automatically updated so you always have an accurate 
accounting of its contents.

*** c.  Erasing Files.

The third option under the File Menu is Erase File.  This 
allows you to get rid of a file by removing it from the user 
ROM.  This is also referred to as "deleting" a  file.  To erase 
files, use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to find the Erase 
option under the File Menu and press ENTER.  Mini 
TransPort will prompt:
	
	PICK FILE TO DELETE.

It speaks the name of the first file you can delete.  Use the 
UP and DOWN ARROW keys to move through this list and 
find the file you wish to erase.  Once you have located the 
file, press ENTER to delete it and return to the File Menu.

Rather than scanning through the list of files with the 
ARROW keys, you may simply enter the name of the file to 
delete.  Use Mini TransPort's keypad to enter text (refer to 
Chapter 2) and press ENTER.  As before, the file is deleted 
and you are returned to the File Menu.  Do not use this 
function unless you are sure you want to delete files.  Unless 
you have another copy stored, once a file is deleted it is 
gone for good.

*** d.  Renaming Files.

The fourth entry in the File Menu is the Rename option.  
This allows you to change the name of files within the user 
ROM.  To rename a file, use the UP and DOWN ARROW 
keys to find the Rename option under the File Menu and 
press ENTER.  Mini TransPort will prompt:
	
	PICK FILE TO RENAME.

It then speaks the name of the first file in the directory list.  
Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to move through this 
list and find the file to rename.  Once you have located the 
file, press ENTER and Mini TransPort prompts:
	
	ENTER IN THE NEW FILE NAME.

Type the new file name using Mini TransPort's keypad 
(described in Chapter 2) and press ENTER.  The file name 
must have no more than eight characters, a period and three 
more characters for the extension (Mini TransPort's file 
names follow the standard DOS file naming conventions).  
After entering the filename, Mini TransPort will respond:
	
	DONE. 

You are then returned to the File Menu.

As with the Erase File option, you do not have to use the  
ARROW keys to move through the list of files to select the 
file to be renamed.  You may simply type the name of the 
file, press ENTER, type the new name for the file when 
prompted and press ENTER again.

While you may change the name of an Alarm file, do not 
modify its "A L M" extension.  Without this identifying 
extension, the files will not function properly.

*** e.  Copying Files.

Use this command if you want to create a second copy of an 
existing file but under a different name.

>>From the File menu, use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to 
find the Copy option and select it with ENTER.  Mini 
TransPort will prompt:
	
	PICK FILE TO COPY.

and then speak the first file in the file list.  Use the UP and 
DOWN ARROW keys to find the file you want to copy and 
press ENTER.  Mini TransPort prompts:
	
	ENTER IN THE NEW FILENAME.

Type the new name for the file and press ENTER to 
complete the process.  Mini TransPort will copy the file and 
then respond:
	
	DONE.

You are then returned to the File menu.  

*** f.  Memory Left.

The Memory Left option tells you the amount of memory in 
kilobytes (one kilobyte is approximately 1000 characters) 
free in your user ROM.  This option reports the amount of 
free memory left for storing files.  From the File menu, use 
the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to find this option and press 
ENTER to instantly hear the memory available report.

*** g.  Format Your User ROM.

The seventh and final option in the File Menu is Format 
Device.  In order to store files in Mini TransPort's User 
ROM, it must be formatted so that it can be detected and 
interpreted properly.  Mini TransPort's User ROM is 
formatted prior to being shipped from the factory.  
However, should you decide to reformat it, here's what to 
do.  We will assume that you have connected the A-C 
adapter to Mini TransPort and plugged it in to the wall or 
outlet strip.

>>From the File Menu, use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to 
locate the Format Device option and press ENTER to select 
it.  Mini TransPort prompts:
	
	FORMATTING DEVICE WILL REMOVE ALL DATA FROM IT.  
	CONTINUE?

To abort the format, press the DOWN ARROW or ESCAPE 
keys and you will return to the File Menu.

To continue with the format, press UP ARROW.  The ROM 
disk takes around a minute to format.  You will hear a series 
of beeps to let you know that the format is progressing.  
When finished, Mini TransPort announces:
	
	DONE.

You are returned to the File Menu, placing you on the 
Format Device option.

** 4.  The Options Menu.

The fourth entry in the Main Menu is the Options Menu.  
This menu handles a number of Mini TransPort's 
miscellaneous utilities and contains the following entries:

VERBOSE MODE.
POWER MODE.
BATTERY CHECK.
DEVICE STATUS.
DOWNLOAD SPEECH ACCESS.
REPROGRAM MINI TRANSPORT.
SPEAK SERIAL NUMBER.
BURN IN USER NAME.

Enter the Options Menu from the Main Menu by using the 
UP and DOWN ARROW keys to find it and press ENTER.

*** a.  Verbose Mode.

For those of you who like the reassurance of more detailed 
prompting, Mini TransPort has a "verbose" feature which, 
when ON, speaks expanded prompts and instructions.  
When you first enter the Options Menu, you are on the 
Verbose Mode option which will be spoken along with its 
current setting.  If it is OFF, press ENTER to toggle it ON.  
Once ON, you will hear:

	OPTIONS MENU.  USE UP AND DOWN ARROWS TO PICK CHOICE.  
	PRESS ENTER TO SELECT, OR PRESS ESCAPE TO ABORT.  
	VERBOSE MODE ON.

Press ENTER again and this time you will hear:

	OPTIONS MENU.  VERBOSE MODE OFF.

With Verbose Mode ON, go through some of the menus 
you have previously visited.  Listen to the instructions given 
for different menus.  After a while, you will feel comfortable 
enough with Mini TransPort so that you won't need the 
additional instruction and you can turn the Verbose Mode 
OFF.  In general, Verbose Mode reminds you to use the UP 
and DOWN ARROW keys to cursor to a choice, press ENTER 
to select an option, press ESCAPE to abort, and so on.

*** b.  Power Mode.

The second entry in the Options Menu is Power Mode.  The 
Power Mode determines whether you want the battery 
saving options ON or OFF.  Find the Power Mode option 
with the UP and DOWN ARROW keys and press ENTER to 
select it.  You will find that there are two settings; Normal 
and Drain.  Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to locate 
one and select it with ENTER.

Mini TransPort defaults to the Normal option so that all of 
the battery saving circuitry is active.

The battery Drain option allows you to completely 
discharge your batteries before recharging them.  This may 
be necessary if your battery develops a charge "memory" 
(see explanation in Chapter 1).  You may also use this 
option when running Mini TransPort on batteries but need 
to eliminate noise introduced by the battery saving features 
when, for example, using a tape recorder to record speech 
output from Mini TransPort while in the field.  The A-C 
adapter must be unplugged for this feature to be effective.

*** c.  Battery Check.

The next menu option is Battery Check.  Again, locate it 
with the UP and DOWN ARROW keys and enter it by pressing 
ENTER.  Like the Verbose Mode feature, Battery Check is 
toggled ON and OFF by pressing ENTER.

With Battery Check ON, Mini TransPort informs you when 
the battery is getting low.  Thereafter, you will not hear the 
warning again unless Mini TransPort is turned OFF then ON 
which prompts the battery low message to repeat.

Once you receive a "battery low" warning, plug in the A-C 
adapter or replace the user replaceable battery pack with a  
fresh one.

We recommend you leave this feature ON all of the time for 
maximum protection.

*** d.  Device Status.

The Device Status option provides you with a quick run-
down on some of Mini TransPort's settings that might effect 
your performance.  Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to 
find this option and press ENTER to select it.  You might 
hear:
	
	ADAPTER NOT PLUGGED IN.  ADAPTER POWER OFF.  
	SERIAL PORT NOT READY.  BATTERY POWER GOOD.

Or you might hear:

	ADAPTER PLUGGED IN.  ADAPTER POWER ON.  
	SERIAL PORT NOT READY.

The first two announcements tell you whether or not your 
A-C adapter is plugged in and whether or not Mini 
TransPort is receiving power from your A-C outlet.  These 
are not redundant.  If, for example, your adapter is plugged 
into Mini TransPort but it is not plugged into a wall socket 
or is not functioning properly, Mini TransPort reports that 
the adapter is plugged in but that it is not receiving any 
power.  If you hear this, check the connections on your A-C 
adapter.  If these are proper, you may have a problem and 
should call Artic Technologies for assistance.

"Serial Port Not Ready" means that no cable is connecting 
Mini TransPort to your computer.  However, if a cable is 
connecting these two devices and you still get this message, 
it might mean that your cable is bad or that your computer 
is not communicating correctly with Mini TransPort.

The last status announcement tells you about the present 
status of your battery pack.

*** e.  Download Speech Access.

You can take advantage of a special Mini TransPort feature 
that allows you to store your favorite screen review 
program in Mini TransPort's ROM and, when necessary, 
transfer it to a computer via the serial port.  With this 
function, any IBM computer can become instantly 
accessible.  This comes in handy should you need to work 
with a computer that does not contain your screen access 
software and the master diskette is unavailable.

**** 1)  Creating and Loading the Necessary Files.

If you are using a screen review program other than 
Business Vision, you must create two files with specific 
filenames and upload them to Mini TransPort's User ROM 
or this feature will not work.  These two files are 
TRANSFER.EXE and TRANSFER.BAT.  You must also 
upload the MINICOM.EXE file which is supplied on the 
diskette that  comes with Mini TransPort.

TRANSFER.EXE  is the file that contains all of your 
	      screen reader files.
TRANSFER.BAT  is a batch file that copies TRANSFER.EXE 
	      to your computer, extracts its files, and 
	      issues the necessary commands to run the 
	      screen review program. 
MINICOM.EXE   is the program used to copy TRANSFER.EXE 
	      from your supplied floppy disk or hard 
	      disk subdirectory to Mini TransPort's ROM 
	      drive.

NOTE:  Business Vision users will find the files 
TRANSFER.BAT and TRANSFER.EXE customized for 
Business Vision on a diskette supplied with Mini 
TransPort.  Therefore, you will not need to create these 
files, but you will need to copy them from the diskette to 
Mini TransPort's user ROM.

The following procedure describes how to create  
TRANSFER.EXE and TRANSFER.BAT, then copy them  
to Mini TransPort.  You will then learn how to use the  
Download Speech Access feature in Mini TransPort to 
install and automatically run your screen review program.

CREATING TRANSFER.EXE:  In order to create TRANSFER.EXE 
(the file that contains your screen review software) you 
must use a file compression program that combines and 
compresses many files into one.  We recommend you use the 
file compression utility PKZIP, version 2.04G.  You can 
obtain this utility from Artic's BBS or from bulletin 
boards in your area.

The examples listed here will assume that you have and will 
use PKZIP version 2.04G.

To begin, go to the subdirectory on your computer that 
contains your screen reader files.  It is a good idea to move 
any files that are not required to run your screen review 
program (such as documentation files) to a temporary 
subdirectory.  Compressing only the required files saves 
storage space and shortens the time it takes to install your 
screen review program.  After paring your files down to 
what is absolutely needed, type the following command on 
the computer keyboard from the DOS prompt:
	
	PKZIP TRANSFER -RP A *.*

and then press the ENTER key  This command creates a file 
called TRANSFER.ZIP which contains all of your screen 
reader program files, honoring subdirectory and path names 
where applicable.  While PKZIP creates the file 
TRANSFER.ZIP, it prompts you regarding file progress 
and notifies you when it is finished working.  Now type:

	ZIP2EXE TRANSFER

and press the ENTER key.  This command converts the 
TRANSFER.ZIP file to a file called TRANSFER.EXE (the 
required self-extracting file).

CREATING TRANSFER.BAT:  Now, lets create a batch 
file called TRANSFER.BAT that, when executed, unpacks 
the screen review files in TRANSFER.EXE and runs them.
Here is a sample screen review batch file.  Feel free to 
modify it to suit your own needs.  

IMPORTANT:  You must start your batch file with the first 
three commands as shown below and end it with the 
command that starts your screen review program.

The first command in TRANSFER.BAT is:
	
	CTTY CON

This command returns control of the computer to the 
console and is required at the top of the batch file.

The next command is:

	MINICOM /C% /S# /T

This command starts the MINICOM.EXE program passing 
three parameters. They are:

/C%     where % is the number of the appropriate serial port.
/S#     where # is the appropriate character to determine 
	the Baud rate.
	/ST  =  Top speed.
	/SF  =  Fast speed.
	/SM  =  Medium speed (9600 Baud)
		(default if no value specified)
	/SS  =  Slow speed.
/T      the command instructing MINICOM to perform 
	a remote transfer.  This command is required.

The third command is:
	
	TRANSFER.EXE -O -D

This command unpacks TRANSFER.EXE, honoring 
subdirectories and overwriting screen review files by the 
same name.  This command is required.

The next command in the batch file is:
	
	START PROGRAM

Do not type these words literally.  Simply enter the 
command that starts your screen review program.

NOTE:  you can perform other batch file commands 
before starting your screen review program, but you must 
end your batch file with the command that starts your 
screen reader.

COPYING FILES TO MINI TRANSPORT:  Now that you have created 
the necessary files, let's transfer them to Mini TransPort.  
Let's start by creating a subdirectory on your computer's 
hard disk that contains the following three files: 

MINICOM.EXE
TRANSFER.EXE
TRANSFER.BAT

and the update files supplied by Artic Technologies.  To do 
this, from the DOS prompt, type the following on your 
computer's keyboard:

	MD \UPDATE

and then press the ENTER key.  UPDATE is the name of the 
subdirectory you are going to use for this process.  Change 
to this subdirectory by typing:

	CD \UPDATE

followed by the ENTER key.

Next, copy all of the files starting with the word 
TRANSFER from your diskette or the subdirectory 
containing your screen review program into this directory.  
For example, if the files are on floppy disk drive A, type:

	COPY A:\TRANSFER.*

and press the ENTER key.

If the files are on hard disk drive C, in a subdirectory called 
VE, you would type:
	
	COPY C:\VE\TRANSFER.*

and press the ENTER key.

Make sure there is a space after the word COPY when you 
type this command.  After copying the TRANSFER.EXE 
and TRANSFER.BAT files to the UPDATE subdirectory, 
copy the file MINICOM.EXE from the floppy disk that was 
supplied with your Mini TransPort by typing the following 
command on your computer's keyboard:
	
	COPY A:MINICOM.EXE

and press the ENTER key.  If your floppy drive is B:, 
substitute B: for A: in this command.

Now you are ready to run MINICOM.EXE to transfer the 
files from the UPDATE directory on your computer's disk 
to Mini TransPort.  You should still be in the UPDATE 
subdirectory, so all that you need to do is type the following 
command from the DOS prompt:
	
	MINICOM

and press ENTER.  You should hear the prompt:
	
	MINICOM CONNECTED.

confirming that MINICOM.EXE is loaded and ready to go.  
Now press Function Key 3 (F3) on your computer's 
keyboard.  This instructs MINICOM to send a file to Mini 
TransPort.  When you do this, you will be asked for the 
name of the file you wish to transfer.  In this example, type 
the file name:
	
	TRANSFER.EXE

and press ENTER.  Your file will be sent to the User ROM 
on Mini TransPort and you will be notified when it is 
finished transferring.  Repeat these steps to send 
TRANSFER.BAT and MINICOM.EXE.  When you finish 
transferring these files, you will be ready to perform a 
remote transfer (use the Download Speech Access 
function).

**** 2)  Performing a Remote Transfer

Sending your screen review program to your computer is 
easy.  You need only memorize the first step. Mini 
TransPort prompts you the rest of the way.  Listed below 
are all of the steps with an explanation so that you can see 
how it works.

Before you start, make sure that your computer is at the 
DOS prompt and in the disk drive where you want your 
screen review program installed (preferably Drive C).

Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to locate the Download 
Speech Access entry in the Options Menu and press ENTER.  
>>From here on, you will follow instructions from Mini 
TransPort.

Mini TransPort prompts:
	
	PICK THE SERIAL PORT TO USE FOR THE TRANSFER.

followed by:
	
	COM1.

This is the first entry in a menu which lists COM1 through 
COM4.  You will need to know to which serial port on your 
computer Mini TransPort is connected before proceeding.  
Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to find the appropriate 
port and press ENTER to select it.  Mini TransPort prompts:
	
	PICK THE SPEED TO USE FOR THE TRANSFER.  
	NORMAL.

This is another menu with three choices: SLOW, 
NORMAL, and FAST.  For computers with only floppy 
drives, or those older XT models that have hard drives but 
extremely slow CPU speeds, use the NORMAL setting.  
For 286, 386, and faster computers, the FAST option safely 
transfers Business Vision from Mini TransPort.  Use the UP 
and DOWN ARROW keys to choose the speed to use and 
press the ENTER key to select it.

You will hear a warning message concerning the DOS 
SHARE and other programs that might interfere with the 
procedure.  After this warning, Mini TransPort informs you 
that you can skip further instructions by pressing ENTER (to 
proceed immediately) or obtain instructions by pressing any 
other key.  We recommend that, until you are familiar with 
the instructions for transferring your screen access program 
to a computer, you press any key other than ENTER to get 
prompting.  Press any key other than ENTER and you will 
hear the following message: 
	
	YOU WILL NEED TO TYPE TWO COMMANDS FROM YOUR 
	COMPUTER KEYBOARD TO INSTALL YOUR SCREEN READER.  
	PRESS ANY KEY WHEN READY FOR THE FIRST ONE.

When you press a key, Mini TransPort spells the first 
command so that you will type it in as you hear it.  The 
command is:
	
	MODE COM#:1200,N,8,1,P

followed by the ENTER key.  Substitute the actual COM 
port number for the number sign (#) in the above command.

This command sets the serial port on your computer for a 
Baud Rate of 1200 characters per second, no parity bits, 8 
data bits, 1 stop bit and a parameter to improve handshaking 
between the computer and Mini TransPort.  This command 
ensures that the settings for your computer match the ones 
Mini TransPort expects or file transfers will not happen.  
Complete the step as instructed and proceed to the next 
command.  When finished, Mini TransPort prompts:
	
	PRESS ENTER FOR THE NEXT INSTRUCTION OR ANY OTHER 
	KEY TO REPEAT THE LAST INSTRUCTION.

If you missed any of the first instruction and did not type in 
the command, press any key to repeat it.  If you have 
entered the first command correctly on your computer 
keyboard, then press the ENTER key on Mini TransPort's 
keypad to hear the second and final command that you must 
enter on your computer's keyboard. Mini TransPort now 
prompts you to type the following command:
	
	CTTY COM#

followed by the ENTER key.  Substitute the actual COM 
port number for the number sign (#) in the above command.

Again Mini TransPort prompts you to press ENTER to go to 
the next instruction or any other key to repeat.  Repeat the 
last instruction as many times as you wish, and when you 
are ready, press ENTER to initiate the file transfer.  You will 
hear Mini TransPort say:

	STARTING TRANSFER, MAKING DIRECTORIES.

This lets you know that Mini TransPort and your computer 
are successfully communicating.  For each file transferred, 
Mini TransPort reports the number of kilobytes sent for that 
file.  At the end of each transfer, Mini TransPort informs 
you that the file was successfully sent.  When all files are 
transferred, TRANSFER.BAT is automatically executed on 
your computer to extract the files from TRANSFER.EXE, 
and run your screen review program.

If you hear the following message, you know you have a 
problem: 

	ERROR IN TRANSFER.  UNABLE TO COMPLETE REMOTE BOOT.  
	PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE.

It is usually due to an incorrectly typed instruction on the 
computer keyboard, choosing the wrong COM port, 
improper cabling or a faulty serial cable.  Repeat the steps 
outlined above.  Make sure to accurately follow the 
instructions from Mini TransPort and select the proper serial 
port.  If that does not work, check your connections.  If 
they are sound, then try replacing the serial cable.  If you 
are still having trouble, contact Artic Technologies for 
assistance.

NOTE:  If you have purchased Business Vision with your 
Mini TransPort, see the documentation enclosed with 
Business Vision for instructions on its use.

*** f.  Reprogramming Mini TransPort.

Mini TransPort performs a variety of useful functions to 
assist you in your day to day activities.  It does this because, 
like any computer-based device, it contains an operating 
system and a set of programmed instructions stored in a 
special ROM.  We are constantly evaluating and developing 
improvements to its operation as well as new features 
designed to increase its utility.  This means that from time to 
time, we will issue special upgrades to Mini TransPort's 
operating system, applications or utilities.  The next entry in 
the Options Menu is Reprogram Mini TransPort.  It 
provides a way to transfer the upgrade information sent to 
you on disk to Mini TransPort's internal ROM.

NOTE:  Mini TransPort's internal system ROM is different 
from the User ROM and is not accessible to the user.

The reprogramming of Mini TransPort is accomplished with 
the MINICOM utility.  (We will cover the rest of 
MINICOM in the next chapter).

To reprogram Mini TransPort, you must connect it to a wall 
outlet via the A-C adapter and to your computer using the 
serial cable.

Let's start by creating a subdirectory on your hard disk that 
contains MINICOM.EXE and the update files supplied by 
Artic Technologies.  To do this, from the DOS prompt type:
	
	MD \UPDATE

followed by the ENTER key, where UPDATE represents the 
name of the subdirectory used for this process.

Change to this subdirectory by typing:
	
	CD \UPDATE

followed by the ENTER key.

Copy the MINICOM utility into this directory.  For 
example, if MINICOM is in the \ARTIC\VISION 
subdirectory, type:
	
	COPY C:\ARTIC\VISION\MINICOM.EXE

and hit ENTER.  Make sure there is a space after the word 
COPY when you type this command.

Copy the update file contained on the update disk to the 
\UPDATE subdirectory.  For example, place Mini TransPort's 
update disk in drive A.  Now type:
	
	COPY A:*.*

followed by the ENTER key.  Remember, leave a space after 
the word COPY in this command.  The \UPDATE subdirectory 
should now contain the MINICOM utility and Mini TransPort's 
update file.

Now you can update Mini TransPort.  Make sure that your 
Mini TransPort is ON and properly cabled to the computer.  
It does not matter where you are in Mini TransPort's menu.  
On your computer's keyboard (not Mini TransPort's 
keypad) type:

	MINICOM /ST

where /ST sets MINICOM to top transfer speed.  You 
could have used /SF to set MINICOM to a fast speed.  In 
either case, press ENTER.  You should hear:
	
	MINICOM CONNECTED.

from Mini TransPort's speaker.  If not, check your cabling, 
make sure Mini TransPort is ON, connected to the A-C 
adapter and plugged in.

Once you hear the "MINICOM CONNECTED" prompt, 
find Mini TransPort's Options Menu with the UP and DOWN 
ARROW keys and press ENTER.  Locate the Reprogram 
Mini TransPort Option with the UP and DOWN ARROW keys 
and press ENTER again.  You will hear two important 
messages.  First, Mini TransPort reminds you that it must be 
connected to a computer with MINICOM loaded for the 
reprogramming to work.  Second, Mini TransPort reminds 
you that the A-C adapter must be connected.  Mini 
TransPort then prompts:
	
	DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE?

Press UP ARROW or ENTER to continue the reprogram.  To 
abort the reprogram, press DOWN ARROW or ESCAPE.  If 
you continue, Mini TransPort prompts you to press ALT-F3 
on your computer keyboard to begin the reprogramming.

Mini TransPort beeps during its reprogramming and will re-
start once the process is complete. The READ.ME file that 
comes on the update disk provides you with information on 
changes and additional Mini TransPort features 
implemented with the upgrade.

*** g.  Speak Serial Number.

This choice in the Options Menu speaks your Mini 
TransPort serial number (and your name, if it's burned in), 
the model of your Mini TransPort, and the version number 
of the current software every time you press the ENTER key.  
This is useful when calling Artic Technologies for technical 
support.  You can also access this feature without going 
through the menus by pressing the MODE key to place Mini 
TransPort's keypad in TURBO Mode and then pressing 
FUNCTION KEY A.

*** h.  Burn-In User Name.

This option allows you to permanently burn your name or 
other identifying information into Mini TransPort for 
security purposes.  This identifying information may be up 
to seventy characters in length.

If you press ENTER while on this option, you will be asked 
for your name.  Type in your name (or any other identifying 
information you wish to use) and press ENTER.  From that 
point on, your name will always be a part of your Mini 
TransPort and cannot be removed or changed unless your 
Mini TransPort is sent back to Artic Technologies.

** 5.  The Serial Menu.

The fifth entry on the Main Menu is the Serial Menu. It 
controls four parameters that govern serial communications. 
Locate the Serial Menu under the Main Menu using the UP 
and DOWN ARROWS and then press ENTER to select it.  
Once there, you will be placed at the top of the list of the 
four communications parameters and two default functions:

BAUD RATE.
CHARACTER LENGTH.
PARITY.
STOP BITS.
SET TO ACCENT DEFAULTS.
SET TO MINI TRANSPORT DEFAULTS.

Briefly, the Baud Rate determines the number of bits per 
second at which data is transmitted to and from your 
computer.  The Character Length determines how many 
binary digits make up each character.  The Parity setting 
determines the method of error checking in data 
transmissions.  The number of Stop Bits determines how 
many binary digits are sent after each character.

If you only use Business Vision, you should never need to 
change these options since the MINICOM utility and the 
Business Vision screen review software handle the setting of 
serial port parameters automatically.  If you use other 
screen readers (especially those that use a nonstandard 
parameter set such as the default settings for the external 
Accent synthesizer), you will need to set Mini TransPort to 
match them or your speech will not work.  Mismatched 
serial parameters cause speech to sound unintelligible.  Your 
screen reader software manual should instruct you in the 
proper parameter settings for an external accent synthesizer 
and these parameters should be matched with Mini 
TransPort.  Mini TransPort uses the standard parameter set 
when using Business Vision and MINICOM: Baud Rate of 
9600, Character Length of 8, no Parity, and 1 Stop Bit.  
However, some packages may instruct you to set the Parity 
to "Even", a Character Length of 7, and the number of Stop 
Bits to 2.

To do this, go to the Main Menu and use the UP and DOWN 
ARROW keys to locate the Serial Menu.  Select it with the 
ENTER key.  Mini TransPort prompts:
	
	SERIAL MENU.  BAUD RATE.

followed by the current setting for the Baud Rate.  To 
change this rate, press ENTER.  You are placed in the list of 
Baud Rates which range from 300 to 115,000 baud.  Use 
the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to locate the speed you 
want and press ENTER to select it.  You are then returned to 
the Serial Menu.

Use your DOWN ARROW to move to the next parameter.  
You will hear:
	
	CHARACTER LENGTH.

followed by the current value.  This option is also entered 
with ENTER, which places you on a menu of two choices: 
seven and eight.  Like the Baud Menu, these options are 
accessed with the UP and DOWN ARROW keys.  Use the 
ARROW keys to locate the number you desire and press 
ENTER to select it and return to the Serial Menu.

Move down to the third parameter and you will hear:
	
	PARITY.

followed by the current setting.  Press ENTER to go into the 
Parity Options Menu.  Your choices are ODD, EVEN and 
NONE.  They are accessed with the UP and DOWN ARROW 
keys.  After choosing the Parity setting you want, select it 
with ENTER.  You are then returned to the Serial Menu.

Moving to the fourth and last parameter, you will hear:
	
	STOP BITS.

followed by the current setting.  Use ENTER to go into the 
Stop Bits Options Menu.  You are placed on a list 
containing two choices: ONE and TWO.  Use your UP and 
DOWN ARROW keys to locate your choice and hit ENTER to 
select it and return to the Serial Menu.

The final two entries in this menu will set the four 
communications parameters to predefined values.  For the 
Accent defaults, the values are:

BAUD RATE:         9600
CHARACTER LENGTH:  7
PARITY:            None
STOP BITS:         1

For the Mini TransPort defaults, the values are:

BAUD RATE:         9600
CHARACTER LENGTH:  8
PARITY:            None
STOP BITS:         1

** 6.  P.A.L. Files.

As previously stated, Mini TransPort supports special kinds 
of files that you customize to suit your own needs.  These 
are called P.A.L. files, which is short for Personal 
Appointment Look-up.  There are four PAL files that you 
can create, store and reference as needed.  They are:

PHONE.
ADDRESS.
TO DO LIST.
OTHER.

PHONE is a quick name and phone number list that you can 
use to keep track of clients, friends or other important 
numbers.  You can also dial the phone number in a PAL 
phone entry.  We will describe how to do this later in this 
section.

ADDRESS allows you to store and retrieve a list of names 
and addresses.  How you use this is strictly up to you: a 
client list, names and addresses of family or friends.  In any 
case, the PAL system is flexible enough to serve your needs.

TO DO LIST is a file you can create to list the things you 
need to do.  Change the items as you accomplish your tasks.

OTHER is file to use if the PHONE, ADDRESS or TO DO 
LIST files do not meet your specific requirements.

*** a.  Creating a PAL File.

The best way to learn how to create a PAL file is to 
demonstrate how they are built.  The following is a listing of 
three sample files supplied with Mini TransPort.  Read the 
accompanying explanations.  Note that PAL files are 
created on your computer, stored as ASCII files and saved 
using the following file conventions:

PHONE       =  PHONE.TXT
ADDRESS     =  ADDRESS.TXT
TO DO LIST  =  TODO.TXT

Sample PHONE.TXT file entries:

(ENTRY TITLE)
** John
(ENTRY)
453-3234

(ENTRY TITLE)
** Stan
(ENTRY)
(513) 342-2313

(ENTRY TITLE)
** Mark
(ENTRY)
(123) 456-7890 Ext 3234

(ENTRY TITLE)
** Pete
(ENTRY)
1-800-324-4124 

Do not use the words ENTRY and ENTRY TITLE when 
creating your own PAL file.  We use them here to help you 
see how a PAL file is constructed.  The ENTRY TITLE 
consists of 2 asterisks, a space, and any text that can fit on 
the first line of the record.  The ENTRY consists of text 
starting on line 2 and ending at the next set of asterisks.  
Though your ENTRY TITLE is limited to one line, the 
ENTRY itself can be as long as it needs to be.  The sample 
ADDRESS and TO DO LIST files illustrate this point.

Sample ADDRESS.TXT file:

** Artic Technologies
55 park St.
Troy, Michigan 48083

** Clark Kent
1234 Lois Lane
Metropolis, MI 48321.

** Mr. Anyone
150 Anywhere Dr.
Anytown, USA 12345

Sample TODO.TXT file:

** Chores
Take out the garbage.
Pick up the kids.
Do the dishes.
Buy more Mini TransPort's.

** Appointments
10:30 A.M.  Meeting with boss
12:00 P.M.  Lunch with a friend.
2:00 P.M.  Meeting with executive board.

As previously stated the OTHER file is meant to cover any 
needs that you might have which are not logically included 
within the PHONE, ADDRESS and TODO files.  OTHER 
files can be anything in the form *.TXT.  When OTHER is 
selected, you will be taken to a list of all the files with the 
extension TXT on the ROM Drive.

*** b.  Sending a PAL File to Read.

After creating your PAL files, you must load them into Mini 
TransPort.  To do this, copy the files into the directory that 
contains your MINICOM.EXE file.  Then type on your 
computer keyboard:
	
	MINICOM

to start the program.  Press the F3 key (Function Key 3) on 
your computer keyboard to transfer files from your 
computer to Mini TransPort.  When asked for the name of 
the file to send, type the name of the appropriate PAL file 
and press ENTER.  The file will be sent and Mini TransPort 
will announce:
	
	DONE.

to let you know that the process is finished.  For more 
information concerning transferring files between your 
computer and Mini TransPort, please read Chapter 4.

*** c.  PAL File Reader Keys.

Now that you have sent a PAL file to Mini TransPort, it is 
time to read it.  To do this, go to Mini TransPort's Main 
Menu.  Use your UP and DOWN ARROW keys to locate the 
PAL File option and press ENTER.  You are placed at the 
top of a list of PAL file options that correspond to the PAL 
files you may have created:

PHONE       opens the PHONE.TXT file.
ADDRESS     opens the ADDRESS.TXT file.
TO-DO LIST  opens the TODO.TXT file
OTHER       places you at the top of the list of all files 
	    with an extension of .TXT.  Use the UP and DOWN 
	    ARROW keys to locate the specific PAL file that 
	    you want and press ENTER to open it.

Use your UP and DOWN ARROW keys to locate the specific 
PAL file that you sent to Mini TransPort and press ENTER.

You will hear the first field in the file you created.  To 
access the remaining portions of the file, use the following 
PAL file reading keys:

UP & DOWN ARROWS  Scroll through ENTRY TITLES.
ENTER             Read the ENTRY itself.
ESCAPE            Return to PAL menu.
MODE+KEY1         Scan ENTRY TITLE list
MODE+KEY2         Page-Down to the next page of ENTRY TITLES.
MODE+KEY2+KEY2    Current ENTRY TITLE
MODE+KEY3         Page-Up to the previous page of ENTRY TITLES.
MODE+KEY3+KEY3    Dial the current telephone number in the 
		  PHONE file.
MODE+KEY4         Move to start of ENTRY TITLES.
MODE+KEY4+KEY4    Move to end of ENTRY TITLES.

NOTE: As previously stated, MODE+KEY3+KEY3 dials a 
number that is in the ENTRY section of your current PAL 
file record.  Mini TransPort will generate the 
corresponding touch tones and output them through its 
speaker.  In order for this to work well, the speaker must 
be close enough to the telephone to be picked up cleanly.

** 7.  Reminder Files.

If you create an ASCII file called REMIND.TXT and send 
it to Mini TransPort, it will automatically be read each time 
you power up Mini TransPort.  You can also read this file 
by accessing the Read Reminders option (the last entry in 
Mini TransPort's Main Menu.)  To do this, locate the Read 
Reminders option from the Main Menu and press ENTER.  
You do not have to use asterisks to create an ENTRY 
TITLE in the REMIND.TXT file since, by definition, the 
file is automatically read if it is present.


========================================================================
CHAPTER 4:   The Rest Of MINICOM


In the last chapter you used MINICOM to reprogram Mini 
TransPort and to upload other files.  These are only some of 
MINICOM's capabilities.  Let's take a closer look at the 
MINICOM help screen to see what else it has to offer.  

Pressing the F1 key (Function Key 1 on the computer's 
keyboard) after MINICOM loads will call up the 
MINICOM Help screen.  It is reprinted here to quickly 
familiarize you with MINICOM's functions.

PRESS F1 (FUNCTION KEY 1) FOR THIS SCREEN. 
PRESS F2 (FUNCTION KEY 2) TO RECEIVE A FILE FROM MINI 
	 TRANSPORT.
PRESS F3 (FUNCTION KEY 3) TO SEND A FILE TO MINI 
	 TRANSPORT.
PRESS F5 (FUNCTION KEY 5) TO USE THE COMPUTER'S CLOCK 
	 TO SET MINI TRANSPORT'S TIME.
PRESS ALT-X TO EXIT THE MINICOM UTILITY. 
PRESS CONTROL-C TO ABORT A SERIAL TRANSFER.
NOTE: ALT-F3 IS USED IN THE REPROGRAMMING OF MINI 
  TRANSPORT.ALL OTHER KEYS ARE USED TO SIMULATE THE 
  MINI TRANSPORT KEYPAD.

---------------END OF HELP SCREEN-----------------

NOTE:  when reading this material, make sure to notice 
the difference between references to the four function keys 
on Mini TransPort's keyboard and references to the 
function keys on the computer keyboard.  Mini 
TransPort's function keys are presented as FUNCTION KEY 
A, FUNCTION KEY B, FUNCTION KEY C, and FUNCTION 
KEY D or KEY 1, KEY 2, KEY 3, and KEY 4 while the 
computer keyboard's function keys are referred to as F1, 
F2, F3, etc. or Function Key 1, Function Key 2, Function 
Key 3, etc.. 


* A.  Using MINICOM With Other Screen Readers.

MINICOM is designed to work in perfect harmony with the 
Business Vision screen access software supplied by Artic 
Technologies.  If you are using a screen access program 
other than Business Vision with Mini TransPort, you must 
unload it or MINICOM will not function properly.  If this is 
the case, restart your computer without the screen access 
software by booting from a floppy disk or from your hard 
disk without loading the other screen reader.   MINICOM 
works with Mini TransPort and does not need a screen 
reader to verbalize its prompts.  When finished using 
MINICOM, load the screen access software as before and 
proceed normally.

* B.  Using MINICOM With Business Vision.

You can load MINICOM when Business Vision is running 
with the SynPhonix card as long as you use the "/B" switch. 
You would enter the following command from the DOS 
prompt on your computer's keyboard:
	
	MINICOM /B

This switch informs MINICOM that Business Vision is 
running with the SynPhonix card.  You do not need to use 
this switch when running Business Vision with Mini 
TransPort.


* C.  Sending and Receiving Files.

Occasionally you may want to share files with a friend who 
may not have a modem or may not have the same floppy 
drive size as you do.  You can still transfer files by first 
storing them in Mini TransPort's ROM disk.  Then, simply 
download Business Vision (along with the MINICOM 
utility) onto your friend's machine.  When you run 
MINICOM, your friend's computer can receive files from 
Mini TransPort.  

With MINICOM active, Function Key 2 (F2) instructs 
MINICOM to receive a file from Mini TransPort.  Function 
Key 3 (F3) sends a file to Mini TransPort.  When F2 is 
pressed, MINICOM prompts:

	ENTER IN THE FILENAME TO RECEIVE.

When F3 is pressed, MINICOM prompts:

	ENTER IN THE FILENAME TO SEND.

Once you type the appropriate filename and press ENTER, 
the file is transferred from Mini TransPort to your computer 
or from your computer to Mini TransPort.  You are told 
about the progress of the transfer every 10 kilobytes (10 
thousand characters) depending on the size of the file.  Mini 
TransPort reports when the transfer is complete.

To summarize, you know that F1 brings up the MINICOM 
help screen; F2 allows you to receive a file on your 
computer from Mini TransPort; and F3 allows you to send a 
file to Mini TransPort from your computer.  You also 
learned that the ALT-F3 key combination, when prompted 
to press it, re-programs Mini TransPort.

* D.  Controlling Mini TransPort From Your Computer Keyboard.

All of the other MINICOM keys simulate Mini TransPort's 
keypad.  In this way, you can operate the unit from your 
computer's keyboard instead of  Mini TransPort's keypad.  

For example, the UP and DOWN ARROW keys on your 
computer keyboard equal the UP and DOWN ARROW keys 
on your Mini TransPort's keypad.  Pressing the ESCAPE key 
on your computer keyboard moves you up a level in Mini 
TransPort's menu system (until you reach the Main Menu).  
Pressing ENTER on your computer keyboard has the same 
effect as the ENTER key on Mini TransPort's keypad.  
Therefore, you can enter and operate any Mini TransPort 
application or utility from your computer keyboard.  You 
can enter text for alarm messages using your computer's 
normal letter and number keys (making the use of key 
combinations on Mini TransPort's keypad unnecessary).  
Some may wonder why we waited until now to demonstrate 
how easy it is to operate Mini TransPort from your 
keyboard.  The answer is that to do this, you must have a 
computer connected to Mini TransPort which defeats the 
usefulness afforded it by its portability.  MINICOM does 
give you this option, but we recommend that you first learn 
to operate Mini TransPort and enter text using its keypad.

To get out of MINICOM and back to DOS, press the 
ALT-X key combination on your computer keyboard.  Once 
in DOS, your computer's keyboard no longer controls Mini 
TransPort and you will use its keypad to operate it.

* E.  Setting Mini TransPort's Clock.

You can use MINICOM to set Mini TransPort's clock using 
the date and time from your computer.  Press F5 and Mini 
TransPort will report:

	DATE AND TIME SET.

confirming that its clock has been successfully updated.

* F.  MINICOM Switches.

Here is a brief list of command line switches for MINICOM:

/?  Brings up MINICOM's command line help screen.

/B  Instructs MINICOM that the SynPhonix card is 
    installed and that Business Vision is running.

/C% Where % is the number of the appropriate serial 
    port.  MINICOM /C2, for example, runs MINICOM 
    on COM2.  If no COM switch is specified, 
    MINICOM defaults to COM1. 

/S# Where # is the appropriate letter to set the Speed 
    MINICOM uses to connect Mini TransPort and 
    your computer.  "/ST", for example, is for top speed 
    and recommended for most computers.

      MINICOM /ST  =  Top speed.
      MINICOM /SF  =  Fast speed.
      MINICOM /SM  =  Medium speed (9600 Baud)
		      (default if no value specified)
      MINICOM /SS  =  Slow speed.

/U: Lets you upload (send a file) to the Mini TransPort.  
    The form is /U:FILENAME.EXT where FILENAME.EXT is the 
    name of your file.

/D: Lets you download (receive a file) from the Mini TransPort.  
    The form is /D:FILENAME.EXT where FILENAME.EXT is the name 
    of your file.

/T  the command instructing MINICOM to perform a remote transfer. 


========================================================================
APPENDIX A:   Controlling Mini TransPort With Other Software

When using Mini TransPort with other programs, follow the 
instructions in the application program's manual to ensure 
proper setup and installation.  If Mini TransPort is well 
supported, you can use the commands supplied by the 
manufacturer to control it.

NOTE:  we do not always know how other companies 
choose to support our synthesizers.  Therefore, if after 
following their instructions you cannot get Mini TransPort 
to respond properly, call the software manufacturer for 
technical support.

Mini TransPort accepts speech commands in either PortTalk 
or External Accent format.  No mode switching is required.  
Business Vision automatically selects the PortTalk format 
and needs no setup.  If you are using third party software, 
you will need to instruct the program to use the PortTalk or 
Accent format (reference your third party software manual 
for its requirements).

Appendix B references Mini TransPort commands that third 
party programmers or developers must use when writing 
speech drivers for Mini TransPort.  Ignore these commands 
unless you intend to write a customized program and speech 
driver for Mini TransPort.


========================================================================
APPENDIX B:   Mini TransPort Speech Commands


Mini TransPort accepts speech commands in either PortTalk 
or Accent format.  No mode switching is required.  Artic 
Business Vision automatically selects the PortTalk format 
and needs no setup.  If you are using third party software 
you will need to instruct the program which format to use 
(see the user manual for the third party software's 
requirement).  The Mini TransPort command list contained 
in this Appendix is provided for use by software developers.

** 1.  Mini TransPort Primary Command Codes.

Third party software that is compatible with PortTalk-based 
speech synthesizers may access Mini TransPort.

*** a.  Speech Characteristic Commands.

CONTROL-E R ?  =  Set Speech Rate, where ? is a number 
		  from 0 to 9.
CONTROL-E P ?  =  Set Speech Pitch, where ? is a number 
		  from 0 to 9. 
CONTROL-E V ?  =  Set Speech Volume, where ? is a the 
		  number from 0 to 9. 
CONTROL-E T ?  =  Set Speech Tone, where ? is a letter 
		  from A to Z. 
CONTROL-E N ?  =  Set Number Processor,
		  OFF (? = 0),  ON (? = 1). 
CONTROL-E F ?  =  Set Flat Pitch.
		  OFF (? = 0),  ON (? = 1). 
CONTROL-E A ?  =  Set Acronyms.
		  OFF (? = 0),  ON (? = 1). 
CONTROL-E S ?  =  Set Spelling.
		  OFF (? = 0),  ON (? = 1). 
 
*** b.  Speech Flow Controls.

CONTROL-X      =  Abort speech and be quiet (Instant Flush).

		  number from 0 to 9. 
CONTROL-E I ?  =  Set Speech Index Marker, where ? is 
		  a letter from A to Z. 
CONTROL-E Q    =  Query Speech Index Marker. 
CONTROL-E W    =  Wait for Speech to complete. 

NOTE: To make Mini TransPort send back a response 
when a certain point in the text string is reached, use a 
WAIT followed by a QUERY.  For example, the string:
 
	"hello": CONTROL-E W CONTROL-E Q
 
sends back an index marker after "hello" speaks.

*** c.  Miscellaneous Controls.

CONTROL-E $  =  Reset Mini TransPort. 
CONTROL-A P  =  Read Turbo Port. 

** 2.  Mini TransPort Auxiliary Command Codes.

Mini TransPort is compatible with Accent Commands.  
However, the power-up defaults are different.  You must 
send an Accent reset in order to get Accent defaults.  Third 
party software that is compatible with Accent type speech 
synthesizers may access Mini TransPort (see Accent Manual 
for details).

APPENDIX C:   Trouble Shooting Guide

Below are some commonly asked questions with answers 
we hope will benefit you.

1.  How much memory does Mini TransPort use?

    Mini TransPort does not use any memory in your 
    computer.  The only memory used is the memory 
    required by your screen access program.

2.  Is the Mini TransPort manual on disk?

    Yes!  It is on the diskette you received with the unit.

3.  Can I use Mini TransPort with a note book computer? 

    Mini TransPort is designed to support a variety of 
    Laptop computers.  You need to make sure that the 
    laptop in question has a serial port and can run your 
    screen review program. 

4.  If I loose power for Mini TransPort, do I have to 
    reboot my computer?

    No.  Plug Mini TransPort in and turn it ON.  Normally, 
    you can resume where you left off.  If not, reboot the 
    computer and restart Mini TransPort.

5.  How do I find Mini TransPort's Serial number? 
    
    Mini TransPort's serial number is printed on the bottom 
    of the unit.  You may also hear the serial number by 
    accessing the "Speak Serial Number" menu option from 
    the Options Menu or by pressing the MODE key to shift 
    the key pad to TURBO Mode and then pressing 
	
	FUNCTION KEY A (KEY 1).

    From Business Vision, the serial number is spoken by 
    pressing the question mark (?) key in Control Mode.
