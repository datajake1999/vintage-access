[:dv g5 dd]     Will provide the ability to set the volume
of the DECtalk Express. Values of DD should range
from 60 to 86.

[:power speak|status]   Speaks or provides a character
string of the power status of the DECtalk Express.
The status messages are Battery OK, Battery Low or External
Power ON.

[:power sleep|interval X] Puts the unit in power save mode
or provides a  low battery warning after "X"
seconds.

[:tsr off|on]   Default is "on". When turned "off", the keep-
alive characters sent from the DECtalk Express
to the TSR are not sent. Used when communicating directly to
the COM port.

[:version speak|status]    Causes the DECtalk Express to
speak or return a  character string of the current
version of the firmware.

CTRL C     Causes the DECtalk Express to perform an
      immediate stop speaking and flush any pending text
      and index markers. The unit returns a "CTRL A" when
      the flush is completed. It is recommended that you do
      not send any other text or commands until the CTRL A
      is received. Otherwise some of the text and/or
      commands sent after the CTRL C may also be  flushed.
      If part of a command is flushed it could leave the
      unit in an undeterminable state.

       NOTE: In this version it is necessary to initially
	send two CTRL Cs before the first CTRL A
	comes back.
CTRL N          Pause speaking. CTRL O resumes speaking.
CTRL O          Resumes speaking. CTRL N pauses speaking.

FLOW CONTROL.
The DECtalk Express uses the XON/XOFF (Ctrl-Q/Ctrl-S)
protocol for flow control.

FIRMWARE UPGRADE.
The firmware loader program, LOAD.BAT, will try to determine
if the PC has a 16550 compatible UART. If it finds one, it
will upload the firmware at 57.6KB. If not, it will upload
the firmware at 9600 Baud with an approximately 15-20 minute
load time.
