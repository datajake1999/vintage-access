This article describes an adapter which can be built to connect the
output of the DoubleTalk-PC synthesizer to the auxiliary input of a
computer sound card or other grounded amplifier.

The audio output signal from the DoubleTalk synthesizer originates
in a bridge type amplifier chip. (TLC2471) The output is DC coupled
and the chip really complains if one of its leads is connected to
chassis ground. Simply connecting an audio patch cord from the output
of the DoubleTalk to a grounded external device or your sound card line
input will eventually destroy the amplifier chip. Of course this makes
Texas Instruments happy since they get to sell you a new amplifier chip.
In short don't plug anything into the output of your synthesizer but the
speaker ... or the adapter shown here.

Since the amplifier chip has DC voltage on the output leads an audio
output transformer can be used to isolate the output and safely extract
the audio signal. The isolated (primary) side of the transformer can
then be directly connected into the Line-in connector of a system
sound card. The adapter shown here uses parts which are readily
available from Radio Shack.  It can be plugged into the output of the
DoubleTalk or the external speaker.

The adapter provides audio to both the Left and Right channels of your
sound card (though not in stereo). Once connected you will need to set
your sound card mixer settings and the DoubleTalk volume control to
achieve the best sound level. If you plug the input of the adapter into
the DoubleTalk external speaker you can also control the level using
the speaker volume control. There is also some reduction in the audio
level because the output transformer primary impedance doesn't match the
input impedance of the sound card.

PARTS REQUIRED:
     1 mono mini phone plug (RS #274-287)
     1 stereo mini phone plug (RS #274-284)
     1 audio output transformer (RS #273-1380)
     2 feet of audio cable 3 conductor
     heat-shrink tubing or electrical tape

TOOLS REQUIRED:
     soldering iron and solder
     wire cutters/strippers
     Teflon fingers (if your new to soldering)

ASSEMBLY:
     - Cut a 1 foot section of the audio cable and attach one of the
       center leads to the tip connector of the mono plug and attach the
       shield lead to the ring connector.
     - Attach the remaining piece of cable to the stereo plug. One
       center lead to the tip and the other to the center ring of the
       stereo plug. Connect the shield wire to the ring connector and
       connect the other end to the center tap wire of the transformer
       primary (don't forget to slip on some heat-shrink tubing before
       attaching the wires).
     - Connect the two center wires to the two outside wires of the
       transformer primary.
     - Connect the two wires from the mono plug to the two wires from
       the other side of the transformer (secondary).
     - Wrap any open connections with electrical tape and continue
       wrapping the entire transformer and connections with tape to
       strengthen it.
     - When you are all done, simply plug the mono plug into the
       DoubleTalk output or speaker and plug the other end into your
       sound card. Remember to set your sound card line-in mixer
       setting for best volume.
