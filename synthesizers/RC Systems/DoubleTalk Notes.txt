Kirk,

1. If the DTLT gets a null, AND there is nothing in its input buffer (as
would be the case just after receiving an 18h), it will emit several
bytes identifying itself (which you are already well aware of). This was
originally done for compatibility with the old external Echo
synthesizers. I believe that if you attempt to send anything to the DTLT
while it is sending the ID, it will ignore it because the ID routine is
called from inside the serial 'rupt handler, and 'rupts haven't been
re-enabled yet to allow additional serial input to be processed. A
work-around would be to send 80h instead of 00h if you don't want to use
a CR. (80h works the same as 00h unless a foreign dictionary is loaded;
80h is then processed as some weird-looking French character.) I'm kind
of surprised that this problem hasn't shown itself before now; kinda
late to fix it, but I'll look into it further (perhaps force DTR false
during the ID procedure would be best, since I don't want to start
handling recursive serial interrupts).

2. CTS and DSR are tied together in the DTLT's serial cable for this
very reason. You should see exactly the same activity on both lines. (I
don't know what the LiteTalk does - but it probably drives just one of
the two handshake lines.)

3. If you want to send a word list, just a text file of the words would
be fine.

Sincerely,
