     1.  Introduction

     The Audapter (tm) Speech System is a battery
     powerable, portable, high quality speech
     synthesizer system.  It has been designed to be
     easy to set up and easy to use.

     We at Personal Data Systems have been using
     synthesizers for many years, both for fun and as a
     primary output form, in conjunction with screen
     review programs.  This long experience has enabled
     us to design in features that make the Audapter
     System more convenient to use.  The Audapter
     System's speech can be understood without
     straining; it can be completely configured over
     the interfaces or by the front panel buttons; and
     it has fast response.

     This manual is available in ASCII on several
     formats of floppy disks as well as in Braille and
     on audio cassette.  Some concepts that might be
     easier to express in graphic form in print are
     explained here in words to make the manual more
     useful when read by the Audapter System itself.

               Audapter System User's Guide


     2.  Description

     The Audapter Speech System includes the Audapter
     unit, an AC adapter and the associated
     documentation.  You may also have chosen to
     purchase a cable for connecting the Audapter unit
     to your computer.

     The Audapter unit is a rectangular box.  The top
     surface has a speaker grill.  On the front are,
     from left to right, an audio output jack, a volume
     control knob, the command button and a three
     position on/off switch.  On the back, again from
     left to right, are a 9 pin female serial
     connector, on some units a 36 pin Centronics
     parallel connector, and the AC power jack.

     2.1.  Front Panel

     2.1.1.  Audio Output Jack

     The audio output jack can be used for an earphone
     or an auxiliary speaker.  Plugging into this jack
     will disable the internal speaker.

     2.1.2.  Volume Control Knob

     The volume control knob can be adjusted at any
     time, or set to the best volume for you and left
     there.  The volume may also be changed in the
     Configuration Menu or by sending commands over the
     interface.  See Section 5, Configuration Menus,
     and Section 8, Voice Controls, for more
     information on changing the volume.








                          Page 2


               Audapter System User's Guide


     2.1.3.  Command Button

     The command button has several uses.  It serves as
     a sort of indicator light; pushing the button will
     cause the Audapter System to say "Audapter ready"
     if it is ready to talk.  It also serves as a
     "shutup" button.  If you want the Audapter System
     to stop talking, just push the button and it will
     instantly stop.  The third use is in conjunction
     with the on/off switch for changing parameters
     through the menus.  For more on the menus see
     Section 5, Configuration Menus.

     2.1.4.  On/Off Switch

     The three position on/off switch also has several
     uses.  Obviously, it turns the unit on, when
     pushed all the way to the left and then allowed to
     rock back to the middle position.  The middle
     position is the "on" position.  Having to rock the
     switch all the way to the left is a safeguard
     against turning the unit on when the switch
     accidentally gets pushed.

     The on/off switch also turns the Audapter System
     off when pushed to the right.  Even when the unit
     is "off", the configuration parameters are kept in
     battery backed up RAM.  This means that the
     Audapter System's configuration settings will not
     be lost when you turn the unit off.

     Another use for the on/off switch is in resetting
     the Audapter System to its original factory
     settings, a "Master Reset".  It is possible to
     change the voice parameters in such a way as to
     make completely unintelligible speech.  If this






                          Page 3


               Audapter System User's Guide

     happens, just turn the unit off, then turn it on
     again but continue holding the on/off switch all
     the way to the left for about 10 seconds, until it
     starts to talk.  When the Audapter says "Audapter
     system reset" all parameters will have been
     returned to the factory setting.

     See Section 5, Configuration Menus, for the on/off
     switch's use in configuring your system.

     2.2.  Back Panel

     2.2.1.  Computer Interfaces

     There are two ways of connecting the Audapter to
     computers or modems, the 9 pin female serial
     connector and, on some units, a 36 pin Centronics
     parallel connector.  If you chose to not include
     the parallel option, the parallel connector, if
     present, will not work.

     2.2.2.  Power Jack

     The AC adapter plugs into the power jack.  If your
     Audapter System has the battery option, the AC
     adapter will also recharge the internal power
     battery.

     2.3.  AC Adapter

     The AC adapter included with your Audapter System
     is a 9 volt, 300 milliamp, positive center
     adapter.  Additional adapters are available from
     PDS.

     The Audapter unit may work with other types of AC
     adapters, but using the wrong adapter could
     seriously damage the Audapter System.  You should
     contact PDS before attempting to use any other AC
     adapter/charger.

     3.  Unpacking

     As you unpack your Audapter Speech System, make
     sure you have all the parts listed below and that
     none have been damaged in shipping.

     You should have the Audapter unit and an AC
     adapter.  If you ordered a cable it will also be
     included.  The battery and parallel options are
     completely internal to the Audapter unit so you
     don't have to look for them.  There should also be
     a manual in one or more forms - print, braille,
     diskette or audio cassette.

     You should retain all the packing materials in
     case you need to send the Audapter unit back to
     PDS for servicing or upgrading.  Although the
     Audapter unit is built to take being carried
     around, it is not safe to ship it without plenty
     of padding.  If we do not think that the packing
     you return an Audapter unit in is sufficient, we
     will repack it in our standard packaging and
     charge you for our cost.

     Warning: The Audapter unit does not have any user
     serviceable internal parts.  It contains CMOS
     circuitry that can be easily damaged if the cover
     is removed.  Opening up the Audapter unit will
     void your warranty.

     4.  Installation Instructions

     4.1.  Standalone Test

     You should try out your Audapter System before
     connecting it to a computer.  Just plug the AC
     adapter into the Audapter unit's power jack and
     then plug the AC adapter into the wall or power
     strip.

     Push the on/off button all the way to the left and
     hold it there about 10 seconds, until the Audapter
     starts to say "Audapter system reset" then let it
     rock back to the center.  Holding the switch
     causes a Master Reset which insures that the
     Audapter has all the normal factory settings.
     After a pause you will hear "ready", signifying
     that the Audapter is ready for data input.  Push
     the command button and you will hear "ready"
     again.

     For normal start up, you will just push the on/off
     button all the way to the left and let it rock
     back to the center, avoiding a Master Reset.

     If you don't hear anything from the Audapter there
     are several things to check.  First, even if it is
     a battery unit, make sure the AC adapter is
     plugged into a standard 110 Volt, 60 Hz outlet and
     has power.  Second, make sure the volume is turned
     all the way up.  Next, try another Master Reset,
     waiting a full 10 seconds before giving up.

     If it still doesn't talk, give us a call at 408
     866-1126 between 9 AM and 5 PM Pacific time.  We
     are often in the office until late at night so go
     ahead and try us even if it is later than 5 PM.

               Audapter System User's Guide


     After the Audapter has said "ready" you may either
     connect the cable to your computer or go on to
     menu configuration.  If you are going to connect
     to your computer, be sure to turn the Audapter
     unit off before you connect the cable.

     4.2.  Interface Connection

     The Audapter unit may be connected to any standard
     RS-232C port or, if you have the parallel option,
     any standard Centronics parallel port.

     4.2.1.  Serial Interface

     If you are connecting to an IBM PC, PC/XT, PC/AT
     or compatible you will probably need a null modem
     or null modem cable.  Apples, modems and other
     equipment with DCE interfaces will usually need a
     "straight through", non-null cable.

     The cable wiring needed for most computers is
     included in Appendix A.  Cables for your
     particular application are available from Personal
     Data Systems or you can have them made by several
     other sources.  Contact PDS for the names of some
     other sources.

     4.2.2.  Parallel Interface

     To connect to the parallel port, if you purchased
     the parallel option, plug a standard 36 pin
     Centronics ( "printer" ) cable into the Audapter's
     Centronics connector.

     5.  Configuration Menus

     The Audapter System doesn't need any dip switches
     for changing parameters.  The configuration menus
     and software interface controls take care of
     parameters that may need changing.

     Note that configuration menu changes are temporary
     and are only saved in the non-volatile memory when
     you return to the ready mode.  Hence, if you
     change something in the configuration and turn the
     unit off without returning to ready, the changes
     will not be saved.

     To get into the Configuration Menus, after the
     Audapter unit is powered up, and you have heard
     "ready", rock the on/off switch to the left and
     let it rock back to the center.  This will put the
     Audapter System into the Configuration Menus and
     you will hear "demo".

     Pushing the on/off switch to the left tells the
     Audapter System to turn on or move on to the next
     menu or next menu item.  The command button tells
     the Audapter System to stop or start speaking or
     to change a menu item.  Pushing the on/off switch
     to the left and pushing the command button at the
     same time acts as an escape.

     The other main sections of the Menus are Voice
     Configuration, Serial Configuration and System
     Configuration.

     5.2.  Moving Around the Menus

     When you hear the words "ready", "demo" or "menu"
     you are in one of the main modes or menus.  To
     skip to the next main menu rock the on/off switch
     to the left.  Just keep rocking the switch to get
     back to "ready".  Another, faster way to get back
     to "ready" is to rock the switch and, while
     holding the switch down, push the command button.
     You do not have to wait for the Audapter System to
     finish speaking in any of the menus, just rock the
     switch or push the command button to move on when
     you have heard enough.

     To descend into a main menu, push the command
     button and you will hear the name of the first sub
     menu.  Once you hear the name, you can either
     descend into the sub menu or move on to the next
     sub menu.  To move on, rock the on/off switch.  If
     you keep rocking the switch, you will return to
     the main menu that you entered.

     To descend into the sub menu, push the command
     button.  Keep pushing the button to move among the
     sub menu's choices.  The sub menus wrap around so
     don't be afraid to listen to all the options
     before choosing one.  To choose an option, step
     through the menu until you hear that option.  Then
     rock the on/off switch to the left to choose that
     option and move on to the next item.  If you were
     on the last item of a menu, pressing the on/off
     switch to the left will move you back to the
     beginning of the current menu.

     An item is "set" to the last thing that was spoken
     before you moved on to the next item.  Changes in
     the configuration are temporary and are only saved
     in the non-volatile memory when you return to the
     ready mode.  Hence, if you change something in the
     configuration and turn the unit off without
     returning to ready, the changes will not be saved.

     5.3.  Demo

     The first part of the Configuration Menu is a
     demonstration of some of the Audapter System's
     features.  After hearing "demo" you may push the
     command button and the Audapter System will run
     through the demonstration.  If you want to
     interrupt it at any time, just push the command
     button again and it will immediately interrupt the
     demo then say "demo" again indicating that you are
     back at the top of the demo.

     You can push the command button again to hear the
     demonstration or rock the on/off switch to go on
     to the next menu section.

     5.4.  Voice Menu

     To learn more about the Voice Controls see Section
     8, Voice Controls, and Appendix B, Configuration
     Menu Settings.

     The second main menu is the Voice Menu.  You can
     use this menu to choose your own "standard" voice
     or to design one on your own.

     The first sub menu is Which Voice.  It offers you
     a choice of different voices for your "standard"
     voice.  The choices include the normal voice, the
     jolly giant, the alien, Squeeky, Dorothy, the
     little kid and the whisper voice.  The next option
     is Volume which ranges from 1 to 10 with the
     "normal" at 5.

     The voice parameters you can change are pitch,
     rate, size of mouth and unvoiced level.

     Voice Pitch offers you a range of pitches from 1
     to 10, with the "normal" at 4.



                          Page 11


               Audapter System User's Guide


     Speech Rate offers speeds from 1 to 10, with the
     "normal" at 3.

     Size of Mouth changes the "size" of the speaker's
     mouth.  It ranges in five steps from very small to
     very large.

     The Unvoiced Level sets the amount of "hissiness"
     from mild to strong in three steps.

     Set Tone can be treble or bass.  The treble alters
     tone for use with earphones.

     5.5.  Serial Menu

     The first option in the Serial Menu is baud rate.
     Baud rates range from 50 to 19,200.  See Appendix
     B, Configuration Menus, to see a list of all the
     baud rates available from the menu.

     The next option is Parity which can be even, odd
     or none.

     Data Bits range from 5 to 8.

     Stop Bits can be 1 or 2.

     The choices for Input Handshake are RTS, DTR,
     RTS/DTR and software control.

     The choices for Output Handshake are CTS or none.

     5.6.  System Menu

     The first section of the System Menu tells you the
     model, version and options included in your
     Audapter System and copyright information.  These
     are items that can't be changed by the user; they
     are just for information.



                          Page 12


               Audapter System User's Guide


     The second section allows you to choose how much
     punctuation will be spoken. The choices are all,
     most, some or none.  See Section 6.1., ECHO-like
     Commands, for more explanation of these choices.

     The third section lets you determine how the
     speech is output.  The choices are: character by
     character; word by word; phrase by phrase; after
     first words and then phrase by phrase; and line by
     line.  Character by character causes everything to
     be spelled and word by word causes each word to be
     spoken separately.  Phrase by phrase waits until a
     natural phrase boundary, such as ", " or ". ", to
     speak the phrase.

     After first words and then phrase by phrase is a
     means of forcing speech output to start sooner
     that it would otherwise.  Some screen review
     programs send a large block of text without any
     carriage returns or other means of forcing the
     Audapter to start talking.  If the program is
     translating some characters, such as ";" to
     semicolon, there may be thousands of characters
     getting stored in the Audapter, which is just
     waiting for something to tell it to start talking.

     In this mode, the Audapter will start speaking
     after the first few words instead of waiting for
     the end of the block of text.  The prosodics will
     not be as nice but you won't have to wait so long
     for the speech to start.  If the Audapter seems
     sluggish with your screen review program, try this
     forcing mode.

     The last menu section, if you have the parallel
     option in your Audapter System, is Interface
     Select.  Here you may choose either serial or
     parallel interfaces.  If you choose parallel, the
     Serial Menu has no effect.

               Audapter System User's Guide


     6.  ECHO Emulation

     The Audapter System has been designed to respond
     to ECHO-like commands to enable it to work with
     existing screen review programs that are set up
     for the ECHO.  These commands change a subset of
     the Audapter's Voice Controls.

     ^E stands for control E.  The [ and ] are to be
     typed; the { and } enclose the names of variables
     and are not to be typed.

     6.1.  ECHO-like Commands

       ^Ea  all punctuation mode: all characters,
            including control characters, will be
            announced.

       ^E{num}c  compressed or high speed - it is the
                 equivalent of ^E[r-40]: the optional
                 num, which is between -100 and 100,
                 sets a new default value for the upper
                 rate.  If there is no num, num
                 defaults to the last value set.

       ^E{num}d  announce on input timeout delay: the
                 default is 0 which disables the delay.
                 Num can range from 0 to 15.

       ^E{num}e  expanded slow speed - it is the
                 equivalent of ^E[r0]: the optional
                 num, which is between -100 and 100,
                 sets a new default value for the lower
                 rate.  If there is no num, num
                 defaults to the last value set.

       ^E{num}f  pitch setting with flat inflection:
                 num is between 1 and 63 and the
                 default is about 11.



                          Page 14


               Audapter System User's Guide


       ^E{num}h  head size setting (sample rate): num
                 is between 1 and 19 and the default is
                 about 9.

       ^El  letter mode: each character is spoken
            automatically as soon as it is received.

       ^Em  most punctuation announced mode: most
            control characters, carriage return, line
            feed and space are not announced.

       ^En  no punctuation announced mode: letters,
            numbers, dollar signs, and decimal points
            are the only characters announced.

       ^E{num}p  pitch ( frequency ) setting: num is
                 between 1 and 63 and the default is
                 about 11.

       ^Es  some punctuation announce mode: most non-
            essential punctuation and control
            characters are not announced; this is the
            default punctuation mode

       ^E{num}v  volume or gain setting: num is between
                 1 and 15 and the default is about 7.

       ^Ew  word mode: words are spoken, not spelled.
             A string of text is announced when a
             carriage return or line feed is sent to
             the Audapter.

       ^E?  query command: causes the Audapter to send
            a string containing the model, version and
            feature code over the serial interface.

       ^E[...]  native T-T-S commands - see Section 7,
                Audapter Commands, and Section 8, T-T-S
                Command, for the commands that can go
                in the brackets.

               Audapter System User's Guide


       ^E  space command: a control e followed by a
           space forces speech output.

       ^E^M  carriage return command: forces speech
             output.

       ^E ESCAPE  escape to sleep.

               Audapter System User's Guide


     7.  Audapter Commands

     Each of these commands fits the general pattern:
     ^E[ character { value ,{ value } } ] where ^E
     stands for control e, the [ and ] are typed in,
     the character is in upper case and the { and }
     indicate variables and are not typed.

     7.1.  Announce Punctuation Modes:  ^E[A{chr}]

     {chr} is the character a for announce all
     punctuation, m for most, s for some and n for
     none.

     7.2.  Buffer Status Initialization:
           ^E[B{dec1},{dec2}]

     This command enables buffer status requests.  It
     is used by screen review programs to control the
     flow of information.  The disabled condition is
     the default.  This command should be sent only
     once for initialization.

     {dec1} specifies the level and {dec2} specifies
     the character to be used to request a status
     indication.  {dec2} may be set to 2 to choose ^B.

     After this initialization sequence, whenever the
     Audapter receives a ^B, if {dec2} was 2, it will
     immediately sum up the internal input text
     buffers, count unprocessed characters and send "<"
     if there are less than {dec1} characters waiting
     or ">" if there are more.









                          Page 17


               Audapter System User's Guide


     7.3.  Change the Audapter Command Prefix:
           ^E[C{dec1},{dec2}]

     {dec1} is the ASCII value of the new command
     prefix and {dec2} is the ASCII value of the new
     cancel character, in decimal form.  The default is
     ^E[C5,24] for a command prefix of ^E, ASCII 5, and
     a default cancel character of ^X, ASCII 24.

     7.4.  Speech Delay Timer Setting: ^E[D{num}]

     {num} = 0 means speech will not be forced by a
     timeout.  If num is greater than 0 the Audapter
     System will force speaking of any text left in the
     input buffer num times .2 seconds after the last
     text is input.

     7.5.  Keep or Save Parameters in Non Volatile RAM:
           ^E[K]

     This command causes the Audapter System to save
     current parameters to non-volatile RAM.

     7.6.  More Input Buffer Level:  ^E[M{dec}]

     {dec} sets the number of characters that defines
     the point at which the input buffer is not too
     full and the Audapter should signal the inputting
     device to resume sending data.













                          Page 18


               Audapter System User's Guide


     7.7.  Normalizer Flags:  ^E[N{num1},{num2}]

     {num1} = 0 refers to possible case conversion of
     strings of all capital letters.

     ^E[N0,1] is the default and causes strings of all
     capital letters to be pronounced as a whole word,
     assuming there are some vowels in the string.

     ^E[N0,0] causes strings of all capital letters to
     be spelled out letter-by-letter.

     {num1} = 1 refers to the way that the letter "a"
     is pronounced.

     ^E[N1,1] causes the letter "a", by itself, to be
     pronounced as "ah".

     ^E[N1,0] is the default and causes a solo "a" to
     be pronounced as "ay".

     7.8.  Output Mode:  ^E[O{char}{dec}]

     {char} = c means to output character by character;
     w means word by word; p means phrase by phrase; f,
     force mode, means after first words then phrase by
     phrase; and l means line by line.  In the case of
     f, {dec} is the number of words that define the
     "first words".

     Force mode is especially useful with screen review
     programs such as the IBM Screen Reader.  It forces
     speech out at the earliest opportunity instead of
     waiting for the carriage return at the end of a
     string of text.  Text is forced after the first
     {dec} words of the line and at phrase boundaries
     such as ", " and ".  ".  This can substantially
     decrease the response time so that the Audapter
     begins speaking immediately instead of waiting for
     completion of the transmission of a long screen of
     text.

               Audapter System User's Guide


     7.9.  Pause/Resume Character Definition:
     ^E[P{dec1},{dec2}]

     {dec1} is the ASCII value of the new pause command
     and {dec2} is the ASCII value of the new resume
     command, both in decimal form.  The default pause
     command is ASCII 16 and the default resume command
     is 18 or ^E[P16,18].

     7.10. Query for Model and Version:  ^E[Q]

     The Audapter System will return information on the
     model and version number.  If you are using a
     modem program the reply will come back before you
     send the closing bracket but be sure to include it
     or some of the following information will be lost.

     7.11. Synchronize:   ^E[W]

     Wait for speech output to finish before processing
     the next command.

     7.12. Power-Saving Mode:  ^E[Y{num}]

     This command has been added to control "yawning"
     or "dozing" mode.  {num} is the number of seconds
     the Audapter system will wait without anything to
     do before turning off power to the audio circuits.
     A {num} of 0 will disable the power-save.

     7.13. Force Text:  ^E[^M]

     Use this command when you want to force speech in
     all punctuation mode.  It forces speech without
     having the carriage return spoken as "return".

     8.  T-T-S Commands

     To help you better understand the Audapter System,
     we have included a description of the Berkeley
     Speech Technologies' T-T-S which does the actual
     conversion of text to speech.

     8.1.  Homograph Marker(~)

     A number of English spellings, "homographs", can
     be pronounced in more than one way, for different
     meanings.  For example: wind, expose, minute,
     duplicate, buffet.  T-T-S assigns ambiguous
     spellings their more common pronunciation.
     However, if you place a tilde (~) in front of the
     spelling some homographs will be assigned their
     alternative pronunciations from entries in the
     system exceptions dictionaries.

     For example:

       In less than a minute, ~minute quantities began
       to appear.

       They tied a bow on the ~bow of the boat.

       You should ~duplicate my duplicate copy.

       After a strong wind they would ~wind up in the
       middle of the lake.

       The way she makes her entrance ~entrances me.

     8.2.  Special Punctuation

     The normal English punctuation marks such as
     period and comma create prosodic (intonation)
     contours in sentences which are read by T-T-S in
     Text Reading Mode.  Additional punctuation marks
     can be added to a text to change the way that it
     is pronounced.  These marks allow you to add

                          Page 22


               Audapter System User's Guide

     emphasis, change the pitch contour, and introduce
     pauses without resorting to Phoneme Reading Mode.
     Using these marks, you can have T-T-S pronounce
     your text with the desired prosodic nuances, yet
     still retain the regular English spelling of the
     words.

     This additional mark is currently implemented:

       "]" - produces a shorter comma-like pause;

     The question mark in English printed text is
     pronounced both with and without a rising
     intonation.  For the kind of question that has a
     rising intonation, use "]?" instead of "?".

     8.3.  The Phonemic Modes: Phoneme Reading ^E[p]
           and Exception Entering ^E[x]

     It is sometimes useful to bypass the T-T-S Text
     Reading Mode modules which convert English
     spelling to phonemic equivalents for
     pronunciation.  The sounds of English can be
     precisely represented in ASCII text using BST's
     phonemic transcription system.

     In the transcription, each distinctive sound of
     English - each English phoneme - is represented by
     a separate symbol made up of one or two keyboard
     characters which correspond to the special
     characters used in the phonemic representations of
     pronunciation in standard dictionaries.  As much
     as possible, letter characters are used for
     phoneme symbols as they are used in regular
     English spelling.  Stress in words, pitch levels
     and boundaries between words and sentences can
     also be represented by special symbols.  The
     phoneme symbols are presented below in Section
     8.3.1.




                          Page 23


               Audapter System User's Guide


     Phonemic transcriptions are used by T-T-S:

     1) In Phoneme Reading Mode.  T-T-S can read
     phonemic transcriptions directly.  This allows you
     to specify exactly how you want individual words
     or even a full text pronounced.  For example, some
     women with the name "Diane" might prefer to use
     the French pronunciation, "dee YAHN", which would
     be transcribed phonemically as ^E[p] d i y a ' n
     ^E[t].

     Every phoneme string has to be terminated by ^E[t]
     or it may not be handled properly.  Single words,
     as in this example, are just followed by ^E[t].
     Phrases or full text need a ^E[t] before any
     carriage return and another ^E[p] at the start of
     the next line.  If a phoneme string is so long
     that it is automatically terminated before the end
     of the buffer it may not be handled properly.

     2) In Exception Entering Mode.  An English letter
     sequence (word) is entered into the User Exception
     Dictionary (UED) along with a new phonemic
     pronunciation.  It is not spoken directly.  After
     an exception has been entered in the UED the
     phonemic pronunciation is selected every time the
     word appears in text.  The changed pronunciation
     continues until you turn the Audapter off.
     Exceptions can be pronounced completely
     differently from the way they are spelled in text.
     For example, a real estate listing application
     program might want to abbreviate "three bedrooms
     with view" as "3BRMWVU".  Entered in the UED, it
     would receive the full pronunciation.

     8.3.1.  Symbols for Phonemic Transcription of
             Words

     One symbol is used for each distinctive sound
     (phoneme) of standard American English.  In the
     lists below, each phoneme is illustrated by a list
     of example words in which it appears.  The lists
     are arranged to demonstrate the contrasts between
     similar sounds.

     Consonant phonemes:

      w  ---  watt  wet  woo  quit  Duane  wham
      y  ---  yacht  yet  you  use  argue  yam
      h  ---  hot  heard  who  hi  ahoy  ham

      m  ---  sum  ramp  my  limb  ample  moose
      n  ---  sun  rant  nigh  Lynn  handle  noose
      ng  ---  sung  rank  drunk  long  ankle

      l  ---  lots  stole  feel  sold  lily  fled
      r  ---  rots  store  fear  soared  rare  Fred

      f  ---  fat  half  rough  lift  phase  off
      v  ---  vat  have  shove  lived  cover  vivid
      th  ---  booth  author  ether  anthem  thesis
      dh  ---  smooth  other  either  rhythm  these
      s  ---  sue  bus  lace  recent  city  oxen
      z  ---  zoo  buzz  lays  resent  zitty  exact

      ch  ---  batch  chin  hitch  nature  virtual
      jh  ---  badge  gin  Jeff  soldier  gradual
      sh  ---  bash  shin  chef  nation  racial
      zh  ---  beige  measure  vision  fusion

      b  ---  bats  robe  baby  beak  obey  amble
      p  ---  pats  rope  puppy  speak  opaque
      d  ---  door  mad  dime  did  buzzed  road
      t  ---  tore  mat  time  strut  bussed  wrote
      g  ---  got  rag  ogre  Greg  agog  figs
      k  ---  cot  rack  ocher  quake  pique  fix

     Vowel phonemes (as they are pronounced in stressed
     syllables):

      i  ---  beet  leak  ease  we  ski  eel
      I  ---  bit  lick  is  spirit  hear*  ill
      e  ---  bait  lake  came  way  steak  ale
      E  ---  bet  Lech  desk  merry  head  el
      ae  ---  bat  lack  ask  graph  had  Al

      u  ---  boot  Luke  dune  move  stew  cooed
      U  ---  put  look  bush  lure  tour  could
      o  ---  boat  choke  flow  woe  oboe  code
      O  ---  bought  chalk  flaw  store*  long
      a  ---  pot  lock  spa  mark  starry  cod

      ^  ---  but  luck  done  just  hull  cud
      R  ---  Bert  lurk  earn  mirth  journey  curd

      ay  ---  bite  like  hire  why  eyes  aisle
      oy  ---  boy  join  hoist  coy  oink  oil
      aw  ---  bout  pound  house  cow  ouch  owl

     Any of the vowel phonemes listed above for
     stressed syllables can appear in unstressed
     syllables as well.  For example, the final
     syllable of "lucky" has the same vowel phoneme
     ("i") as "keep".  Those forms starred (*) contain
     vowels which are conventionally considered to be
     lax due to the following "r".  There is an
     additional vowel phoneme ("=") that only appears
     in unstressed syllables.

       =   ---  canal( 1st syllable )
                support( 1st syllable )
                action( 2nd syllable )
                tickle( 2nd syllable )

               Audapter System User's Guide


     8.3.2.  Stress Symbols

     Stress symbols in words are placed after the vowel
     of the stressed syllable.  Primary stress is a
     single quote ' ; secondary stress is double quotes
     ".  Boundaries between words in multiword
     transcriptions are marked by the symbol $W.

     Stress marks and phoneme symbols must always be
     preceded by a space.  If a phoneme symbol is made
     up of two characters ("sh") they must be kept
     together.  For example:

       quiche  k i ' sh
       pizza  p i ' t s =
       fettuchine  f E " t = ch i ' n i
       three bedroom
       ^E[x]3BR th r i " $W b E ' d r u m ^E[t]
       (UED abbreviation)

     8.3.3.  Phoneme Reading Mode

     To enter Phoneme Reading Mode, type ^E[p] anywhere
     in the text.  To return to Text Reading Mode, type
     ^E[t].

     T-T-S always starts in Text Reading Mode so, in
     order to read a file that is written in a phonemic
     transcription, you should begin the file with a
     ^E[p] and end with a ^E[t].  In addition, there
     must be a ^E[t] before any carriage return and
     another ^E[p] at the start of the next line to
     make sure the phoneme strings are handled
     properly.  Every phoneme symbol, including stress
     marks, must be preceded by a space.  Thus, the
     phonemic representation for the word "Renoir"
     would be: ^E[p] r E n w a ' r ^E[t].





                          Page 27


               Audapter System User's Guide


     In Phoneme Reading Mode, you can transcribe as
     little as a single word within a text.  For
     example, the sentence

       Her name is Marcia, which she pronounces
       ^E[p] m a r s i ' = ^E[t].

     would be read:

       "her name is marsha, which she pronounces
       mar-SEE-uh."

     You can also transcribe a sentence, a phrase, or
     even a whole text.  To prepare a text larger than
     a single word for Phoneme Reading Mode, additional
     symbols are required.  These symbols are described
     in Appendix D.

     T-T-S is designed to produce the phonemes of
     standard American English.  It does not have the
     phonemes for other languages, for example the true
     French pronunciation of the final "n" in "bon".
     It will pronounce non-English words just as a
     typical American who doesn't speak the foreign
     language does, not the way a native speaker does.

     It also does not have phonemes which may be in
     other regional English dialects, for example the
     guttural final consonant in the authentic
     Scottish-English pronunciation of "loch".  For
     this reason, a user who speaks a non-standard
     dialect may find that T-T-S will refuse to
     pronounce some transcriptions.  It will also
     reject certain non-English combinations of
     phonemes, such as some consonant clusters in
     Slavic languages and odd sequences entered as
     typing errors.

     8.3.4.  The Exception Entering Mode ^E[x]

     Exceptions are entered in the UED by associating
     an English spelling with its phonemic
     transcription.  To enter an exception in the User
     Exception Dictionary, type both the word and the
     phonemic transcription of how you want it
     pronounced in the following form:

       ^E[x] places T-T-S in Exception Entering Mode.

       ssss is the English spelling of the exception,
       typed without spaces.

       p p p p is its pronunciation in phonemes, with
                each symbol preceded by a space.

       ^E[t] returns to Text Reading Mode.

     Each word that you enter as an exception must be
     preceded by a separate "^E[x]" and followed by
     "^E[t]" and a carriage return.

     For example:

       ^E[x]Renoir r E n w a ' r ^E[t]
       ^E[x]pizza p i ' t s = ^E[t]

     A list of exceptions for a particular application
     can be kept as a separate text file to be read
     into the UED as the first step in running an
     application program.

     Exceptions can also be placed anywhere within a
     text file which will be read by T-T-S.  If they
     are placed at the beginning of the file, they will
     be read into the UED before the file is
     pronounced.  After user exceptions are loaded into
     the UED, the pronunciation of the exception
     continues in the changed form, unless it is
     changed again, or you turn off the Audapter unit.

     8.4.  Voice Characteristic Controls

     The Audapter System's speech can be changed in
     several ways by changing the Voice Controls.  The
     different controls and their ranges are listed
     below.

     Note that the [ and ] are to be typed in but the
     { and } set off variables and are not to be typed.
     The case of the control is important; all these
     controls use lower case letters.

     8.4.1.  Voiced excitation function:  ^E[e{num}]

     This control changes the excitation function
     accessed by the chip.  {num} is an integer in the
     range of 2 through 7.  The default is 3.  The
     value 2 gives an entirely voiceless output
     (whispering).

     8.4.2.  Fundamental frequency:  ^E[f{dec}]

     This control determines the overall pitch of the
     voice.  It affects inherent pitch characteristics
     of the speaker, but not the intonation. {dec} can
     be 39 to 4500 Hz, in integer increments.  The
     default is 80.  An out-of-range value will cause a
     return to the default fundamental frequency.

     8.4.3.  Overall gain:  ^E[g{num}]

     This control determines the overall loudness of
     the speech output. {num} is a positive or negative
     integer, in units representing 3/4 dB.  The
     default is 21.







                          Page 30


               Audapter System User's Guide


     8.4.4.  Pitch topline:  ^E[h{num}]

     This control changes the pitch range of the voice
     by increasing or decreasing the Hz value of the
     pitch topline.  Raising the topline makes the
     speaker's intonation sound more emphatic.

     {num} can range from -10 to arbitrarily large
     positive numbers.  The higher the number the
     higher the topline.  The default value is 0.
     Whenever fundamental frequency is changed, {num}
     is reset to the default value.

     8.4.5.  Speaking rate:  ^E[r{percentage}]

     This control changes the rate of speech (i.e.,
     makes the voice speak faster or slower).
     {percentage} is a positive or negative integer
     representing a percentage change to be applied to
     the default rate.  Positive values increase sound
     durations by the given percentage, negative ones
     decrease it.

     8.4.6.  Sample rate:  ^E[s{num}]

     This control changes the rate at which speech
     samples are output.  It is an important control
     for changing voice quality.  See the discussion on
     changing voices in Section 8.5., below.

     8.4.7.  Unvoiced gain:  ^E[u{num}]

     This control increases or decreases the amplitude
     of voiceless segments relative to voiced ones.
     {num} can be a positive or negative integer, in
     units representing 3/4 dB.  The default is -18.

               Audapter System User's Guide


     8.4.8.  Wait before next frame:  ^E[w{num}]

     This control causes the preceding frame of speech
     data to be repeated in the DSP speech chip for
     {num} more cycles or pitch periods.  This can be
     used to stretch out a sound or to add longer
     silences between sounds.  The factory default
     setting for {num} is 25.  If {num} is specified
     with a value greater than zero, it will become the
     new default wait time.  Examples:  ^E[w], ^E[w1],
     ^E[w25], ^E[w100].

     8.5.  The Sample Rate Control

     Altering the sample rate of speech output can
     change the character of the voice.  This change
     will be perceived by the listener as an apparent
     change in the identity of the speaker.  By
     increasing the sample rate, all frequencies
     present in the signal will be shifted upward.  The
     effect will be as though the speaker had a smaller
     vocal tract.  Decreasing the sample rate will
     shift all frequencies downward and make it seem as
     if the speaker had a larger vocal tract.

     The syntax for altering the sample rate is:
     ^E[s{num}], where {num} can take on values from 0
     through 63.  0 is the fastest sample rate possible
     and 9 is the default sample rate.

     For example, ^E[s4] will produce a voice that has
     higher frequencies than the default voice.










                          Page 32


               Audapter System User's Guide


     With an increase in sample rate, both the spectral
     peaks and the fundamental frequency are shifted
     upward.  The rate of speech is also increased.  A
     decrease in the sample rate has the opposite
     effects.  To keep fundamental frequency and speech
     rate constant with a change in sample rate, use
     the following settings ('r' is the speech rate
     control, and 'f' is the fundamental frequency
     control):

       ^E[s0]   ^E[r24]   ^E[f61]
       ^E[s1]   ^E[r22]   ^E[f63]
       ^E[s2]   ^E[r19]   ^E[f65]
       ^E[s3]   ^E[r16]   ^E[f67]
       ^E[s4]   ^E[r14]   ^E[f69]
       ^E[s5]   ^E[r11]   ^E[f71]
       ^E[s6]   ^E[r8]    ^E[f74]
       ^E[s7]   ^E[r5]    ^E[f76]
       ^E[s8]   ^E[r3]    ^E[f78]
       ^E[s9]   ^E[r0]    ^E[f80]   (default voice)
       ^E[s10]  ^E[r-3]   ^E[f82]

     8.6.  Index Marks:  ^E[i], ^E[i{dec1}] or
           ^E[i{dec1},{dec2}]

     {dec1} is from 0 to 7 and {dec2} is any whole
     decimal number from 1 through 32,767.

     Index marks are a means of letting the Audapter
     System communicate with the computer whose serial
     port it is connected to.  If text sent to the
     Audapter System contains index marks, the Audapter
     stores an index value and/or sends the index value
     back to the host computer over the serial
     interface whenever an index mark is processed.  An
     application program in the host computer can use
     the index values to keep track of which words have
     been spoken.

     {dec1} determines whether there is a response,
     whether the response (if any) is in normal command
     format or short form and whether the index value
     in the Audapter System's memory is updated.

     {dec2} determines the index value that is stored
     in the Audapter System and/or sent to the host
     computer.  If {dec1} is blank, 0, 5, 6 or 7,
     {dec2} may be included but will be completely
     ignored.  If {dec2} is not in the range of 1 to
     32,767 it will be ignored.  If {dec2} is not
     included or is out of range in an index marker
     that is supposed to set the index value the stored
     index value will not be changed.

     ^E[i] or ^E[i0] is short response only.  It
     responds with either the default, ASCII 9 which is
     a tab character, or with an index value you
     previously set.

     ^E[i1] is long response only.  It responds with
     "^E[i1,{dec2}]" where {dec2} is either the
     default, 9, or the index value you previously set.


                          Page 34


               Audapter System User's Guide


     ^E[i2,{dec2}] is set and short response.  It sets
     the index value to {dec2} and also responds with
     the ASCII character whose decimal value is {dec2}.
     If {dec2} were 7 then the response would be a
     bell.

     ^E[i3,{dec2}] is set and long response.  It sets
     the index value to {dec2} and also responds with
     "^E[i3,{dec2}]".

     ^E[i4,{dec2}] is set the index value only.  If
     {dec2} is out of range there will be no action
     taken.

     ^E[i5] increments the index value only.

     ^E[i6] increments the index value and sends a
     short response.

     ^E[i7] increments the index value and sends a long
     response.

     We suggest that, when initializing your system,
     you send ^E[i4,9] to make sure that the index
     value is 9 and then use ^E[i] as your usual index
     marker.  The reply that your computer will see is
     ASCII 9, a tab character.

     8.7.  Change the Lead-in Character:  ^E[c{dec}]

     {dec} is the ASCII value of the new lead-in
     character in decimal form.  Note:  the command
     lead-in character can be quoted simply by doubling
     it.

     8.8.  T-T-S Command Summary

     Each of these commands fits the general pattern:
     ^E[ character { value { ,value } } ] where ^E
     stands for control e, the [ and ] are typed in,
     the character is in lower case and the { and }
     indicate variables and are not typed.
     ^E[c{dec}] -- change command lead in character
     ^E[e{num}] -- voiced excitation function
     ^E[f{dec}] -- fundamental frequency
     ^E[g{num}] -- overall gain
     ^E[h{num}] -- pitch topline
     ^E[i{dec1}{,dec2}] --   index marker entered in text
     ^E[p] -- phoneme reading mode
     ^E[r{percentage}] speaking rate

     Appendix A: Interface Cables

     A.1.  The Audapter System Serial Interface Pin Out

     The Audapter System matches the AT 9 pin RS-232C
     pin out and is a DTE device.  Because it is DTE
     you will need a null modem to switch the lines
     when going to a PC, XT, AT or PS2 computer or
     compatible.

           Pin #   Signal Name

             1     DCD Data Carrier Detect input

     A.2.  Which Cable to Use

     IBM PC, XT, AT and PS2 computers and compatibles
     with 9 pin connectors will need the 9 pin null
     modem cable (see Section A.2.) and those with 25
     pin connectors will need the 25 pin null modem
     cable (see Section A.3.).

     Apples, modems and other equipment with DCE
     interfaces will probably need the Modem/Apple
     cable (see Section A.4.).

     Appendix C: The Standard BeSTspeech T-T-S Text
     Normalizer

     C.1.  Overview

     This section provides documentation for the normal
     performance of the Text Normalizer Module of the
     T-T-S program in the BeSTspeech System.  Many
     decisions made by the default Normalizer can be
     altered using the Controls described in Section 7.

     To be read correctly, a text must be interpreted
     according to the conventions of written English.
     This is the work of the Text Normalizer.  One of
     its primary functions is to assign an unambiguous
     meaning to characters and constructions that could
     be read in different ways in different
     circumstances.  Here are some examples:

     1.  A semicolon usually signals a prosodic pause;
     it is not pronounced:

       This semicolon is an example; the one in the
       sentence above is also.

     However, when a character is cited (enclosed in
     quotation marks), it does not signal a prosodic
     pause but should be pronounced.  The sentence

       The C language requires a ';' at the end of each
       statement.

     should be pronounced:

       "the cee language requires a semicolon at the
       end of each statement."

     2.  The digit "2" contributes to a different
     pronunciation in each of the following
     constructions:

       200 "two hundred"

       12 "twelve"

       2nd "second"

       20 "twenty"

     3.  In addition to ending sentences, periods have
     a number of other functions.  For example, they
     can:

       Mark an abbreviation: "etc."

       Be part of a file name: "command.com"

       Mark an ellipsis: "Well..."

       Be a silent decimal point: "$45.98"

       Be a pronounced decimal point: "3.1416"

     4.  A string of uppercase letters is often
     pronounced as the names of the letters, while the
     equivalent lowercase letters would be pronounced
     as regular words:

       POW "prisoner of war"

       ID "identification"

       LA "Los Angeles"

       RIP "rest in peace"

       SAT "scholastic aptitude test"

     The Text Normalizer determines how ambiguous
     constructions like those illustrated in (1)
     through (4) above should be pronounced.

     The BST Normalizer has a number of features that
     are useful for reading generalized sorts of text.

     BST's Text Normalizer also gives the user the
     opportunity to change the way a text is pronounced
     through the use of various pronunciation Controls.
     These Controls are mentioned throughout this
     document and are discussed specifically in Section
     7.

     C.2.  Pronouncing Numbers

     T-T-S pronounces numbers - i.e., sequences of
     digits - in three different ways:

     1. Literally, as the names of the digits:

       1234 "one two three four"

       567 "five six seven"

       9001 "nine zero zero one"

     2. In groups of two:

       1234 "twelve thirty-four"

       567 "five sixty-seven"

       9001 "ninety oh one"






                         Page C-3


                Audapter System User's Guide


     3. As full numbers:

       1234 "one thousand two hundred thirty four"

       567 "five hundred sixty-seven"

       9001 "nine thousand one"

     Each of these pronunciations is appropriate in
     different circumstances.  For example, pronouncing
     digits in groups of two is appropriate for dates
     and addresses:

       In 1985 "in nineteen eighty-five"

       357 Elmwood St. "three fifty-seven elmwood
       street"

     Pronunciation as a full number is appropriate for
     dollar amounts:

       $1985 "one thousand nine hundred eighty-five
       dollars"

       $357.00 "three hundred fifty-seven dollars and
       no cents"

     A literal pronunciation is appropriate for decimal
     amounts and bank account numbers:

       2.1985 "two point one nine eight five"

       005237-1 "zero zero five two three seven, one"

     The Normalizer pronounces numbers correctly in
     each type of context.  To do so, it uses the
     following conventions:





                         Page C-4


                Audapter System User's Guide


     1.  A string of digits will be pronounced
     literally if:

     a. The string is five or more digits long:

       1234567 "one two three four five six seven"

       70083 "seven zero zero eight three"

     b. The string follows a decimal point:

       12.87 "twelve point eight seven"

       3.1416 "three point one four one six"

     2.  A string of up to four digits will be
     pronounced in groups of two:

       279 "two seventy-nine"

       1006 "ten oh six"

       1881 "eighteen eighty-one"

       990 "nine ninety"

     3.  Otherwise, strings of up to four digits are
     pronounced as a full number if:

     a. It ends in "00" or "000":

       800 "eight hundred"

       1200 "twelve hundred"

       3000.5 "three thousand point five"






                         Page C-5


                Audapter System User's Guide


     b. It is a dollar amount:

       $279 "two hundred seventy-nine dollars"

       $1006 "one thousand six dollars"

     c.  If a number includes commas marking off
     thousands, millions, billions, etc., it will be
     pronounced as a full number.  T-T-S can pronounce
     full numbers up to 9,999,999,999,999,999.

       1,006 "one thousand six"

       20,000,000 "twenty million"

       8,622,401,699.127 "eight billion, six hundred
       twenty-two million, four hundred one thousand,
       six hundred ninety-nine point one two seven"

     4. Two decimal digits following a dollar amount
     will be interpreted as cents, if at all possible:

       $35.01 "thirty-five dollars and one cent"

       $.01 "one cent"

       $8.98 "eight dollars and ninety-eight cents"

       $8.98 million "eight point nine eight million
       dollars"

     5.  A digit followed by the appropriate suffix
     will be pronounced as an ordinal:

       1st "first"

       11th "eleventh"

       20th "twentieth"



                         Page C-6


                Audapter System User's Guide


       2,000th "two thousandth"

       53rd "fifty-third"

       22nds "twenty-seconds

     The Normalizer recognizes two other special uses
     of numbers - phone numbers and times of day - and
     pronounces them appropriately.

     6. Phone numbers

     Phone numbers, social security numbers, bank
     account numbers and other hyphenated numbers are
     pronounced literally, with a prosodic pause at the
     hyphen.

       841-5083 "eight four one, five zero eight three"

       6-59802-1 "six, five nine eight zero two, one"

     However, if a group of three or four digits ends
     in a string of zeros, the zeros will be pronounced
     as a "hundred" or a "thousand":

       587-8000 "five nine seven, eight thousand"

       333-4400 "three three three, forty-four hundred"

     These same rules apply to area codes that are
     enclosed in parentheses:

       (800) 764-9009 "eight hundred, seven six four,
       nine zero zero nine"

       (415) 841-5083 "four one five, eight four one,
       five zero eight three"





                         Page C-7


                Audapter System User's Guide


     Some hyphenated numbers are not pronounced
     literally in this way.  Dates and other short
     sequences of numbers that are separated by hyphens
     are pronounced in groups of 2.  For these numbers,
     the hyphen is pronounced as "dash":

       1985-86 "nineteen eighty-five dash eighty six"

       figure 22-3 "figure twenty-two dash three"

     7. Times of day

     The Normalizer can read times of day of a 12-hour
     clock.  It will appropriately read hours, minutes,
     and seconds:

       6:00 "six o'clock"

       6:03:03 "six oh three and three seconds"

       12:59:94.2 "twelve fifty-nine and ninety four
       point two seconds"

     The conventions used by the Text Normalizer give
     the user a great deal of control over how numbers
     are to be pronounced:

     The default pronunciation for long sequences (five
     or more digits) is digit literal.  To pronounce a
     long sequence as a full number, use commas to
     delimit thousands, millions, billions, etc.

     The default pronunciation for short sequences (up
     to four digits) is the one appropriate for dates,
     addresses, and a variety of other uses - in groups
     of two.

                Audapter System User's Guide


     C.3.  Pronouncing Letters and Words

     The Text Normalizer decides which sequences of
     letters are words, which are abbreviations, and
     which should be pronounced literally as the names
     of the letters.

     1. Abbreviations

     The Text Normalizer expands abbreviations where it
     is appropriate to do so:

       Prof. Smith "professor smith"

       63 ft. 11 in. "sixty-three feet eleven inches"

       a, b, c, d, etc. "ey, bee, cee, dee, etcetera"

     It can match the same abbreviation spelling to
     more than one full word:

       Dr. Jones Dr. "doctor jones drive"

       Sr. Castro, Sr. "senor castro, senior"

       St. Agnes St. "saint agnes street"

       Pt. Lookout "point lookout"

       5 pt. "five pints"

     2. Pronouncing letters as their names

     The Text Normalizer recognizes when a group of
     letters should be pronounced literally, as the
     names of the letters.  A sequence of letters will
     be pronounced literally if:





                         Page C-9


                Audapter System User's Guide


     a.  The sequence lacks any of the six vowel
     letters (a, e, i, o, u, y).

       lp record "el pee record"

       fm radio "ef em radio"

       pH "pee aitch"

       55 mph "fifty-five em pee aitch"

     b.  The sequence includes only uppercase letters.

       USA "yu ess ey"

       OK "oh kay"

       IRS "aye ar ess"

       KFTU "kay ef tee yu"

     There are some exceptions to this rule that the
     Normalizer knows about, for example:

       NATO "nato"

       UNESCO "unesco"

       MS-DOS "em ess dos"

     c. The sequence consists of a single letter:

       o's "ohs"

       A) "ey"

       y-coordinate "wye coordinate"

       program.c "program dot cee"



                         Page C-10


                Audapter System User's Guide


     d. The sequence consists of just two letters that
     do not stand alone as an independent word:

       76in8 "seventy-six aye en eight"

       file.ri "file dot ar aye"

     C.4.  Homographic Spellings

     Some words have more than one pronunciation, for
     example:

       read, record, moderate, entrance, close, wound,
       project, invalid and resume

     T-T-S will give these words their more frequent
     pronunciation.  To give them their other
     pronunciation, simply precede the spelling with a
     tilde (~):

       He went in the front entrance.
       His paintings ~entrance me.

       It opens an old wound.
       The clock needs to be ~wound.

     C.5.  Interpreting Punctuation

     The Normalizer interprets the significance of
     various punctuation marks, pronouncing them only
     when they are used in special ways.  For example,
     a period will be pronounced in the following sorts
     of constructions, although it is pronounced
     differently in each one:

       command.com "command dot com"

       9.51 "nine point five one"

       =%.$ "equals percent period dollar sign"


                         Page C-11


                Audapter System User's Guide


     In none of these cases will the period be taken to
     mark a prosodic break (as a sentence-final period
     does).

     Unless they are used in a special way, like the
     periods illustrated above, punctuation marks are
     normally not pronounced.  However, you can have
     them pronounced by changing the Audapter Announce
     Mode to all, most or some.  See Section 8 for more
     information.

     T-T-S interprets punctuation marks according to
     the standard and accepted conventions of written
     English.  For the most part, the user does not
     need to be concerned with the decisions the Text
     Normalizer is making.  However, there are three
     conventions the Normalizer uses that must be kept
     in mind:

     1. The 2-space convention

     In deciding whether a period signifies the end of
     a sentence, the Normalizer may, on occasion, make
     use of the typing convention that sentences are
     separated by at least two spaces.

     2. End-of-line hyphens

     T-T-S assumes that all end-of-line hyphens mark
     true word boundaries.  Texts prepared for T-T-S
     should not divide words at the end of a line.











                         Page C-12


                Audapter System User's Guide


     3. Periods in abbreviations

     Some abbreviations are spelled the same as words
     that are not abbreviations.  For example:

       in ("inches")

       fig ("figure")

       tab ("table")

       apt ("apartment")

       no ("number")

       Jan ("january")

       chap ("chapter")

     For these spellings to be considered
     abbreviations, they must be followed immediately
     by a period.  The Text Normalizer uses the period
     to decide on the correct pronunciation.  T-T-S
     will pronounce most abbreviations correctly even
     when the period is missing, but a period is always
     needed after an abbreviation that is spelled like
     a word:

       It moved 6 in one day. "it moved six in one
       day."
       It moved 6 in. one day. "it moved six inches one
       day."

       apt 2B "apt two bee"
       apt. 2B "apartment two bee"

       No Carolina tobacco "no carolina tobacco"
       No. Carolina tobacco "north carolina tobacco"

     Appendix D: Additional Phonemic Symbols for
     Transcribing Long Passages

     Some users might want to transcribe long passages
     phonemically for reading in Phoneme Mode.  This
     technique provides very precise control of
     pronunciation of words and of intonation contours.
     Experiment and listen to learn how to use the
     symbols described below to get the desired
     prosodic results.

     D.1.  Boundaries and Silence

     In phoneme-reading mode the boundaries between
     words and larger prosodic units must be marked.
     The following boundary symbols are used:

       $W word boundary

       $C a major prosodic boundary

       $P a minor prosodic boundary

     A prosodic pause can be inserted into the speech
     stream by using the symbol for silence:

       sl silence

     Each "sl" symbol represents about 80 milliseconds
     of silence.  Longer periods of silence can be
     obtained by concatenating more than one "sl".
     Utterances that are transcribed without "sl" will
     be pronounced with the words run together as if in
     a single phrase.

                Audapter System User's Guide


     D.2.  Precisely Specifying Stress and Pitch

     It is possible to fine-tune the intonation
     contours of a phonemically transcribed passage by
     the use of stress and pitch markers.  The best way
     to learn to use these is by experimenting and
     listening carefully to the result.

     Stress is indicated by a dollar sign ($).  Pitch
     is indicated by a pound sign (#).  These signs are
     followed by a digit that indicates the level of
     stress or pitch.  Higher numbers indicate higher
     levels.

     As noted earlier, primary stress in words can be
     be marked by placing the symbol ' after the vowel
     of the most stressed syllable in a word.  Using
     the ' symbol has the same effect as using the
     stress level indicator $6.

     The stress and pitch levels for secondary word
     stress " are: $5 #4.  The default stress level is
     $2 (for unstressed syllables).

     When transcribing a full text, stress and pitch
     markers may be used to specify utterance-level
     intonation, not just word-level stress.  A full
     range of stress markers (from $8 to $1) is
     available in phoneme-reading mode, giving you the
     ability to transcribe a wide variety of stress
     patterns:

       $8 highest stress level

       $6 equivalent to primary word stress

       $5 equivalent to secondary word stress





                         Page D-2


                Audapter System User's Guide


       $2 default (unstressed) level

       $1 lowest stress level

     Stress markers mainly affect the duration and
     amplitude of syllables.  The marker must
     immediately follow the vowel of the syllable it
     marks.  Unmarked vowel phonemes are assigned
     default stress.

     Pitch markers are also used to specify the
     intonation contour of an utterance.  So that many
     different kinds of contours can be specified, a
     wide range of pitch targets is made available,
     from #10 to #-3:

       #10 highest

       #6 pitch target for primary stressed syllables

       #-3 lowest

     Pitch targets are associated with:

       (1) Syllables, and

       (2) "$C" and "$P" prosodic boundary markers.

     On syllables, pitch markers immediately follow the
     stress marker.  If a syllable has no stress
     marker, the pitch target immediately follows the
     vowel phoneme for the syllable.  Pitch targets on
     boundaries immediately follow the boundary marker.

     Unmarked prosodic boundaries receive a default
     pitch target.  However, unlike stress, there is no
     default pitch marking for syllables.  The actual
     pitch levels for unmarked syllables are
     interpolated from surrounding pitch targets.



                         Page D-3


                Audapter System User's Guide


     Boundaries can be marked with as many as two pitch
     targets.  Two pitch targets should appear on
     boundaries that have words both to the right and
     to the left.  The first target will be the final
     pitch level for the words that precede the
     boundary and the second target will be the pitch
     onset for the words that follow the boundary.  The
     initial and final "$C" of a text should each have
     only one pitch target.

     Syllables can also have up to two pitch targets.
     However, usually a single target is sufficient.
     Two pitch targets are permitted on stressed
     syllables only to allow for very rapid rises and
     falls in pitch.

     D.3.  Transcription Conventions

     If you transcribe a text completely into phonemes
     to be read in phoneme-reading mode it should start
     with a ^E[p] reset and end with a ^E[t].  The
     first symbol in the transcription should be "$C"
     or "$P".  The transcription should end with the
     sequence "sl $C ;" (a silence, a prosodic
     boundary, and a semicolon).  The minor prosodic
     boundary "$P" can also be used at the end.  A
     default pitch target will be placed automatically
     if none is specified following any prosodic
     boundary, but a different pitch target may be
     specified instead if desired.

     A   Even if your unit has the battery option, make
         sure that the AC adapter is plugged into the
         power jack and into a 110 V, 60 Hz outlet, and
         that the outlet has power.

     B   Turn the volume control all the way up and
         unplug any external speakers or earphones.

     C   Do a Master Reset to reset the unit to the
         original factory settings.  To do a Master
         Reset first turn the unit off then rock the
         on/off switch all the way to the left and hold
         it there for about 10 seconds, until the unit
         starts talking.  If it has not started talking
         by 15 seconds make sure you have power to the
         unit, as in part A, rock the on/off switch to
         off, and try a Master Reset again.

                Audapter System User's Guide

     If you need to talk to us, call 408 866-1126
     between 9 AM and 5 PM weekdays.  If it is later or
     a weekend, it is worth a try too because we're
     often here late.

     Be ready to tell us when you received the unit,
     the serial number, what version it is and a clear
     explanation of the problem and what lead up to it.

     E.4.  Doesn't Talk at All

     If, after reviewing the first steps, the Audapter
     unit still doesn't talk at all, call us at 408
     866-1126.

     E.5.  Talks Nonsense

     If the Audapter is talking nonsense when it first
     comes up, the non-volatile RAM has probably been
     trashed.  A power surge may have caused the
     problem.

     The solution is to do a Master Reset, step C of
     the First Steps above, which rewrites the non-
     volatile RAM and then go through the configuration
     menus to redo any changes you may have saved
     before.

     If the unit is still acting strange, give us a
     call at 408 866-1126.

     E.6.  Talks but Won't Receive Data

     There are several things to check if the Audapter
     is talking fine but doesn't receive data over the
     interface.

     The first thing is to make sure that you have the
     correct cable and that it is plugged securely into
     both the Audapter and the computer.

     Then make sure the Audapter is ready to receive

                Audapter System User's Guide

     data.  Push the command button.  If it says
     "ready" it is ready, if it is in one of the menus,
     get back to the ready mode and try sending the
     data again.

     If you have a unit that includes the parallel
     interface, check the System Menu to be sure the
     Audapter is expecting data on the correct
     interface.

     If you are using the serial interface, go into the
     Serial Menu and check all the parameters.  If you
     do need to change any of the parameters from the
     factory settings, be sure to keep track of what
     the settings are as a Master Reset will change
     them back to the factory settings.

     If you are still having trouble, call us at 408
     866-1126.

     E.7.  Doesn't Save the Configuration

     The most likely cause of not saving the
     configuration is turning the unit off while going
     through the configuration menus, before getting
     back to the ready mode.

     Another possibility is that the host program in
     your computer is changing the parameters.

     The non-volatile RAM's battery is supposed to last
     for many years, but it is possible that the
     battery has failed.  DO NOT try to replace this
     battery.  The battery is built into the RAM chip
     itself and the whole chip must be replaced at the
     factory.

     Call us at 408 866-1126 if you are still having
     problems.  If the RAM needs to be replaced, we may
     be able to give you a work around until there is a
     convenient time for you to get the repair and
     possibly the latest upgrade at the same time.
