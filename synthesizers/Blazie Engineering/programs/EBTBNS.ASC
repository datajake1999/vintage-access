The Easy Braille Translator (EBT) version 1.00 for the Braille 'N
Speak is a general purpose braille translation program designed to
run on The BNS640 with ROM revisions of March 10, 1993 or later. 
The program should also be compatible with the Type 'N Speak as
well. This program was adapted from the EBT program for the
IBM/PC.

                        General Operation

To use this program load in to your BNS or TNS unit.  Go in to the
file menu and point to the program; it should have the name of
ebtbns.bns.  Press the letter x to run the program while providing
arguments.  Enter the name of a normal text file followed by the
name of a braille file to put the output text into.

You may also run the program with an x-chord and the program will
prompt you for arguements.

The program will give you a message if there is a problem accessing
any file.  If all goes well the program will tell you the names of
files after it has successfully opend them and then will prompt you
to press a key to start.

The program will click each time it has processed one line of the
input file.

Pressing a z-chord while the program is running will cause the
program to close all files and terminate.

If a file called ebt.xpt is in your BNS it will be opened and used
as a list of word exceptions.  For example: if it contained the
lines:

holy=\"hl
glory=""gl
kw=,kris ,:itney

then whenever holy, glory, or kw were encountered in your file they
would be replaced with the appropriate text.

If you specify arguments you can gain some control over the
translation process.  To specify arguments you must envoke the
program with an x rather than the x-chord.  When you do this you
must enter the name of the file to be translated followed by a
space and then the name of the output file.  Note: if you do not
specify a .brl extention for the output file the file will not be
considered a braille file by the BNS.  After the two file names you
must put a space then any arguments you desire separated by spaces. 
Each argument is preceeded by a slash (dots 3 4).  Below is a list
of the valid arguments and their meanings.

/1   This switch tells EBTBNS to produce grade 1 braille output.

/s   This switch instructs the translator not to put a "do not
translate" symbol before certain symbols which have braille
representations which are not understood by the BNS.  If this
switch is not present these symbols will be preseeded by a command
which will tell the BNS to treat them as a normal ascii symbol.

/sc  This switch tells EBTBNS to remove any control characters
found in the input file.

/sf  This switch tells EBTBNS to remove any formfeed characters it
finds in the input file.

/sg  This command tells EBTBNS to remove any characters with an
ascii value of greater than 126 from the input file.

Note: all switches above will effect only the output file; the /sg
switch for example will remove the characters in the translation
process so that the output file does not contain graphics
characters; the input file will remain unchanged.

The ebt.xpt file must have only one exception per line.  The
exception word must be followed immediately with no spaces by an
equals sign followed then by the word or phrase which will replace
it: EG

holy="hl

The ascii quote symbol is the braille dot 5.
The ebt.xpt file may contain up to 192 word exceptions.e braille dot 5.
The ebt.xpt file may contain up to 192 word exceptions.
