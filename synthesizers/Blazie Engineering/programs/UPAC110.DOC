** UPAC VERSION 1.10
Welcome to UPAC V1.10! Many things have been changed or updated from the V1.02 
release of this product. An attempt has been made to keep the interface and 
functions as straightforward as possible. This program will run reliably on 
either the BRAILLE'N SPEAK 640 or the TYPE'N SPEAK units from BLAZIE 
ENGINEERING. It will run, granted in limited mode, on units with hardware 
dated before July 2, 1993. It will run in full unrestricted mode on any unit 
dated after that date. 


**What is UPAC?
UPAC, the bns utility pack, is a program for the BRAILLE'N SPEAK 640 that 
combines several useful utilities in to a small, easy to use package. This 
version of Upac has ten major functions. They are:

1. global search and replace
2. text searching
3. word line and character counting
4. file copying
5. file appending
6. file encryption
7. record sorting
8. grade 2 to ascii translation
9. program setup and control switches
10. saving program output 

The program has two modes of operation: an interactive mode and a single 
command mode.

purchase from us. Thank you very much for trying our product and we hope you 
enjoy it. 


**Program restrictions
This version of UPAC is unrestricted in operation provided that you are using 
a BNS/TNS update dated after July 2, 1993. If you are using an earlier version 
of the BNS/TNS internal hardware, the following restrictions are in place.

Any UPAC function that writes information to a file, requires that the file 
being written to be at the end of the file list. Search and replace, file 
copying, file appending and file encryption are the functions mostly affected 
by this restriction. Also, the save program output function is disabled for 
safety on units with the earlier BNS/TNS hardware.

The open current file option, available when you are entering most filenames, 
is not available on the earlier versions. See the discussion of UPAC functions 
for a description of this feature. 

Contact BLAZIE ENGINEERING about updating your unit.


**Running the program
After loading upac.bns in to your BRAILLE'N SPEAK 640, it is ready to run. If 
you start upac with no command line arguments, you will enter the interactive 
mode. type O Chord x and at the prompt type upac then press E Chord or dots 4 
6 Chord. Upac will speak a brief sign-on message. After the message is 
finished, press any key for the upac main menu. In interactive mode, you will 
return to the main menu after selecting any Upac function. To exit Upac, press 
Z Chord from the main menu. 

In single command mode, Upac performs one function, file copy for example, and 
then exits. This mode is ideal for use in BRAILLE'N SPEAK macros. To run Upac 
in single command mode, you need to specify which upac function you wish to 
perform when you start the program. This is done by entering the quick key for 
that function as the first command line argument. See the next section for an 
explanation of quick keys. See the section on quick keys and the single 
command mode, near the end of this manual, for a more detailed discussion of 
the single command mode.


**Moving around the menu
In interactive mode, all Upac functions are available through a menu 
interface. The Upac menu is similar in operation to the BRAILLE'N SPEAKs' 
status menu. You can move backward and forward through the menu using A Chord 
  and dot 4 Chord respectively (up arrow and down arrow on the TNS). C Chord 
  will speak the current menu selection. Additionally, pressing the space key 
    will move forward through the menu just like dot 4 Chord. Once you are 
 pointing at the function you want, press either E Chord or dots 4 6 Chord to 
 activate that function. Alternately, just like in the BRAILLE'N SPEAK status 
 menu, there are quick keys that jump directly to a function and activate it. 
 Pressing dots 3 6 Chord will speak the quick key associated with the current 
 menu selection. TO EXIT THE MENU AND RETURN TO THE BRAILLE'N SPEAK OPERATING 
                            SYSTEM, PRESS Z Chord. 


                               ***UPAC FUNCTIONS


**Search and replace
Search and replace is now available for the BRAILLE'N SPEAK! No more manual 
inserts, no more testing and retesting macros. Upac provides a facility to 
automatically search for all occurrences of a string in a file and replace 
each occurrence of the string with another string. 

When you start Upac for the very first time in interactive mode, the first 
item on the menu is search and replace. After the sign-on message, press any 
key and the program will say: "Upac main menu  search and replace".  Press C 
Chord and the program will repeat the words  "search and replace". Press dots 
3 6 Chord and the program will say the letter S. The letter S is the quick key 
for the search and replace function.  Pressing the letter S from any place on 
the main menu, or supplying it as the first command line argument when running  
Upac, will automatically activate the search and replace function. 

After you have activated the search and replace function, either by pointing 
to it and pressing E Chord or dots 4 6 Chord, or by pressing the letter s, 
Upac will say "file to search". Enter the name of the file you wish to search 
and press enter. You can enter wildcard characters in the filename, E.G. *.doc 
to search and replace in all files with a .doc extension. If you are not 
familiar with this concept, please consult your units' manual. If the file you 
entered cannot be found, or some other error occurred, Upac will speak a 
warning message and return to the main menu. For users of UPAC with the 
newer BNS/TNS hardware, another option is available when you are prompted for 
a filename. If you simply enter the period character "." and press enter, the 
currently opened file in your unit will be used for the search and replace. 
This makes it possible to create a macro that will work in any file without 
you having to enter the filename each time. (see single command mode section 
for an example) 

After you have entered  a valid file, Upac will say "search string". Now enter 
the string you want the program to search for. The string may be up to 80 
characters in length. Once again, end your entry with either E Chord or dots 4 
6 Chord. From this point on, we will simply refer to this as pressing enter.  
All uppercase and lowercase keys can be entered directly into the search 
string, with one exception that will be mentioned shortly. 

After you have entered the search string and pressed enter, the program will 
say "replacement string". Now enter the string you want to replace the search 
string with. Once again, the string may be up to 80 characters in length and 
all letters are directly entered into the string with one exception. There is 
one difference between entering a search string and entering a replacement 
string. When entering a replacement string, you may press enter without 
entering a string. This enters a "0 length" string as the replacement string 
and when the search is done, all occurrences of the search string are simply 
deleted from the file being searched. You can also enter a 0-length string 
from the command line giving you this same feature in single command mode. On 
the command line, enter the two characters \0 for the replacement string. Make 
sure that there is no space between the two characters or an error will be 
noted. (see single command mode section for an example). 

Whenever you are entering strings into the UPAC program, either filenames or 
other strings, the following editing keys are available:

BNS key         TNS KEY         description
L CHORD         HOME            go to start of line
4 5 6 CHORD     END             go to end of line
B CHORD         BACKSPACE       delete character to left
dot 3 CHORD     SHIFT LEFT      move one character left
dot 6 CHORD     SHIFT RIGHT     move one character right
1 5 6 CHORD     (same)          current column on line
R CHORD         (same)          room left on line
I CHORD         INSERT          toggle between insert and overstrike mode
3 6 CHORD       SHIFT END       speak current character
D CHORD         DEL             delete current character

We have referred several times to the one key that is not directly placed into 
a search or replace string. This key is the backslash '\' character. It is 
entered from the keyboard with U Chord followed immediately by dots 1 2 5 6 on 
the BNS; it is a regular key on the TNS.  The backslash character is used by 
Upac to provide a method for entering non-printable characters from the 
keyboard. Follow the backslash character with any number from 0 to 255, and 
the ASCII character with that value will be inserted in the string.  To enter 
a backslash into the string, follow the backslash character with a second 
backslash character.  Several common ascii values have letter shortcuts. 
They are as follows:

\r enters a carriage return into the string (ascii 13)
\n enters a line feed (ascii 10)
\t enters a tab (ascii 9)
\f enters a formfeed (ascii 12)
\s enters a space (ascii 32)

In interactive mode it is not necessary to use the '\s' space shortcut since 
spaces can be entered directly in the string.  The space shortcut is useful in 
single command mode when entering strings that have embedded spaces in them. 
See the section on quick key access for more details. 

As a final note on the backslash-number sequences, some care needs to be taken 
when your string contains a backslash-number sequence followed immediately by 
a normal number. In this case, it is necessary to represent the ascii value 
following the backslash as a three digit number. For example, to enter (ascii 
27) followed by the number 26 into a string the correct sequence is "\02726". 
Otherwise, the backslash sequence will not be correctly interpreted. 

After the replacement string has been entered, you will normally be presented 
with a selection form for picking the case sensitivity of the search to be 
performed. The program will say "search type:" and then 
the type of search currently selected. Simply press the space bar to cycle 
between a case sensitive search and a case insensitive search. Pressing C CHORD 
in this form will speak the current setting and pressing p CHORD will speak 
the parameter and the current setting together. To exit this form, and 
immediately start the search and replace process, press Z CHORD.  The current 
setting of "search type" will be kept as the default value until you either 
change it again in this function or from the program setup function. It is 
possible to skip this case sensitivity selection step, see the program setup 
section for details. 

After you have entered the search and replacement strings, and you have 
selected the type of search, the program will begin the search and replace 
process. You will hear a click from the BRAILLE'N SPEAK  after the program has 
finished working on each page (4096 bytes) of the file.  For a large file, 6 
or more pages, the first few clicks may be widely spaced so don't panic if 
your machine doesn't click for a couple of seconds. When the search and 
replace process is finished, Upac will inform you of how many occurrences of 
the search string were located and then the program will return to the main 
menu. 

If at any time during the process an error occurs, the program will issue an 
error message and return to the main menu. 


** Text searching
Text searching is the second item on the UPAC main menu. It is to the "right" 
dot 4 CHORD of the search and replace function. The text searching function is 
a way to search across multiple files for a given text string. Pressing dots 3 
6 CHORD when pointing at this function will reveal that its' quick key is t.

After selecting this function, UPAC will prompt you for the files to search. 
Enter a filename and press enter. Wildcards and the period (open current file 
symbol) are valid here.

After entering a filename, the program asks  you for the string you wish to 
search for. Enter a string of up to 80 characters and press enter. Unlike in 
search and replace, you cannot enter non-printable characters in this string. 
Only normal, ascii printable characters may be in this string. This ensures 
that the string being searched for is contained on a single line and not 
broken up on separate lines.

After entering the string and pressing enter, you will be presented with a 
small form for selecting different aspects of the text search. The parameters 
that can be set are:

case sensitivity of the search (on or off)
show line numbers (on or off)
pause after each match (on or off)

Move to the item you wish to change using dot 1 CHORD and dot 4 CHORD and 
press the space bar to toggle the available settings. Pressing C CHORD will 
speak the current setting and pressing P CHORD will speak the current 
parameter and its' current setting.

Case sensitivity determines whether the search must match the string exactly. 
If on, it must match exactly, if off it will match in spelling, regardless of 
capitalization.

Show line numbers determines whether the line number containing the matched 
string is spoken. If on, the line number is spoken before the line is spoken, 
if off, no line number is spoken.

Pause after each match determines  whether the program pauses after it finds a 
match. If off, the program will simply run through all the files specified and 
speak each matching line found. If on, the program will pause after each match 
and prompt you to take some action. The available actions are:

press enter to continue searching
press n to skip to next file
press q or Z CHORD to stop searching immediately and return to the main menu

After you have set the parameters to your satisfaction, press Z CHORD to start 
the searching process.  As with the search and replace function, any changes 
made in this selection form will be kept as the defaults until they are 
changed again, either from this function or from the program setup function.

After the search is completed, a count of the  files searched and the lines 
matched is given and you are returned to the main menu. It is possible to skip 
the parameter selection step, see the program setup section for details. 


**Word line and character counting
The third function available on the Upac main menu is "word line and character 
counting". This function provides a way to count the number of words, the 
number of lines and the number of characters for any file in your BRAILLE'N 
SPEAK. This function is located to the "right" (dot 4 Chord) of the text 
search  function on the main menu. When you are pointing at this function, 
press dots 3 6 Chord and you'll find that this functions quick key is the 
letter w. 

After selecting this function, you will be presented with a submenu with four 
options: characters, lines, words, and all. THis submenu works just like the 
main menu and allows you to count only characters, only lines, only words, or 
all three things at once. Select the item you desire just as on the main menu, 
either by the quick key, or by pointing to the item and pressing enter.

After selecting from the submenu, Upac will say "files to count". Enter the 
name of the file you want to count and press enter. If the file cannot be 
found, Upac will inform you of that fact and return to the menu. Once again, 
you may use wildcard characters in the filename if desired. Also, if you are 
using a newer BNS/TNS, entering . in response to the files to count prompt 
will use the currently open file in your unit. 

As the program is reading the file, it will generate a click for each page 
read, just as in search and replace. You will find that this process is very 
fast. When the counting process is completed, Upac will tell you the number of 
files searched, and the number of items counted.


**Copying a file
The next function to the "right" (dot 4 Chord) of the word counting function 
is "copy file". This function allows you to copy a file to a new file. When 
you are pointing at this function, press dots 3 6 CHord and you will find that 
this functions' quick key is the letter c. 

After selecting this function, Upac says "file to copy". Enter the name of the 
file you want to copy and press enter. Again, wildcards are acceptable and
the . (open current file symbol) is allowed for newer units.

The program then says "file to copy to". Enter the name of the file you want 
to copy the first file to and press enter.  Here, wildcards are not allowed!! 

If the file to receive the copy already exists, you will be prompted to verify 
that you want to overwrite it. Press y to overwrite it, n or Z CHORD to exit 
back to the main menu. See the section on program setup to find out how to 
turn this overwrite prompting off.

If an error occurs during copying, an error message is spoken and the program 
returns to the main menu. Otherwise the program will report the number of 
files copied and then return to the main menu.


**Appending to a file
The next function on the Upac menu is "append file". This function is similar 
to the copy file function except that if the second file name you supply 
already exists, it is not deleted. The first file is added to the end of the 
second file. When pointing to this function, press dots 3 6 CHord and you will 
discover that this functions' quick key is the letter a. 

After selecting this function, Upac will say "file to append". Enter the file 
you wish to append and press enter. Wildcards and the . (open current file 
symbol) are valid at this prompt.

The program will then say "file to append to". Enter the name of the file you 
wish to append the first file to.  As with copying, wildcards are not allowed 
at this second file prompt.

As noted in the section on program restrictions, if you are using an older 
BNS/TNS hardware version, this file must be the last file in the file list.  

If an error occurs during the append operation, then the program speaks an 
error message and returns to the menu. Otherwise, Upac gives a count of the 
files appended and returns to the menu. 


**Encrypting a file
The next function available is "encrypt file". This function is provided for 
those who want that added measure of security. The BRAILLE'N SPEAK 640 allows 
you to password protect your files. Unfortunately, this protection only covers 
opening the file from the file menu.  Any external program can read from this 
protected file without any difficulty. The encrypt function will scramble your 
file so that it is virtually impossible to make any sense out of it. When 
pointing at this function, press dots 3 6 Chord and you'll find that the quick 
key for this function is the letter e. 

After selecting the encrypt file function, upac says "file to 
encrypt/decrypt". Enter the name of the file you wish to encrypt (scramble) or 
decrypt (unscramble). Wildcards and the period (open current file symbol) are 
valid at this prompt.

After entering the file, the program says "keyword". If encrypting a file, 
enter the keyword you want the program to use while scrambling the file. If 
you are decrypting a file, enter the same keyword you entered when you 
encrypted the file. The keyword may be up to 80 characters in length and may 
contain embedded non-printable characters. See the section on search and 
replace for information on entering non-printable characters. 

After entering the keyword, the program prompts you to re-enter the keyword 
for security and verification. Re-enter the keyword exactly! If you do not 
re-enter the keyword exactly, an error message is spoken and you are returned 
to the main menu.

After re-entering the keyword correctly, The program starts the encryption 
process. Upac will click after it has processed each page of the file. After 
the encryption process is completed, the program will say "encryption 
completed" and return to the menu. 

A note about keywords: You may encrypt a file with more than one keyword. 
Simply encrypt the file another time giving the program a different keyword 
each time. To decrypt the file, run the program with each keyword used in its' 
encryption. You may decrypt the file in any order. 

WARNING: encryption scrambles files and if you forget the keyword you used to 
encrypt them, they stay scrambled!! Be careful!


**Sort file
Upac now has a sorting facility! The next item on the main menu "sort file" 
allows you to sort records in a file into a second file with some complex 
control over the sorting process.

After pointing to this function, you can see that the quick key for this 
function is o. Think of it as o for ordering.

After selecting this function, you will be prompted for the name of the file 
to sort. Wildcards are not recognized for this filename but the period (open 
current file symbol) is supported. 

After entering the input filename, UPAC prompts you for the name of the file 
to receive the sorted information. Wildcards and the period symbol are not 
supported for this filename. Enter the filename and press enter. 

Next, you will be presented with a small selection form for setting sort 
parameters. Move through the form with dot 1 CHORD and dot 4 CHORD and change 
individual parameter settings by pressing the space bar.

There are four sort parameters available:

1. sort order
2. overlap upper and lower case
3. start at column
4. field width

Sort order, determines the direction of the sort and can be set to normal or 
reverse. Normal sort order is sorting in ascending order and reverse is 
sorting in descending order.

Overlap upper and lower case, is, in effect, case sensitive sorting. It can be 
set to on or off. If on, the sort will be performed as a case insensitive 
sort. If off, the sort will be a case sensitive sort.

Start at column, determines at which column on each line to begin the sorting 
process. This parameter expects you to enter a number from 0 to 131 where 0 
means start at the first position on the line. Enter a number and press enter. 
As an example, to start the sort process at the fifth column on each line, you 
would enter 4 in this field--in effect skip first 4 characters on each line 
and then start sorting. 

Field width, is the width of the field to use when sorting lines. Normally, it 
is the whole line length, 132, but may be made any size from 1 to 132. Enter a 
number here and press enter. This parameter restricts the sort to a subset of 
each line.

Note, files that are to be sorted cannot have lines longer than 132 
characters or an error message will be spoken and you will be returned to the 
main menu. If the start at column and field width parameters indicate an 
invalid sort, E.G. start at column 300 or field width 200, then both values 
will be automatically adjusted so that a valid sort can be performed.

When you have finished setting the sort parameters, press Z CHORD to begin the 
sorting process. It is possible to skip this parameter selection step, see the 
section on program setup.

If the file to receive the sort exists, then you will be prompted to overwrite 
the file. Press y to overwrite the existing file, or press n or Z CHORD not to 
overwrite the file and return to the main menu.  It is possible to skip this 
overwrite prompt; see the section on program setup. 

There are three steps in the sorting process. First UPAC will say "reading 
file" as it reads in the file to sort. Then it will say "sorting" and it will 
click occasionally to let you know that all is still well.  The final step is 
writing out the sorted file. If an error occurs at any point in this process, 
an error message is spoken and you will be returned to the main menu.


**Grade2 to ascii
UPAC's final major function is a grade2 to ascii translator. It will translate 
braille files into straight ascii using the BNS/TNS internal conversion 
routines.  Pointing to this function, you will notice that the quick key is g. 

When you select this function, UPAC will ask you for the name of the file to 
translate. You may use wildcards or the period (open current file symbol) 
here. After you enter the filename, press enter.

UPAC generates an output file name for the translated file by adding the 
extension ".txt" to the input filename. If the output file exists, you will be 
prompted to overwrite it. Press y to overwrite it, n or Z CHORD to abort the 
translation function.

After the translation is completed, you are returned to the main menu.


**Program setup
The next option available on the main menu is the program setup section. This 
is intended to give you greater control over the functioning of UPAC. The 
quick key for this function is the slash '/' character.

After selecting this function, you will be in a selection form that will look 
similar to the ones in the search and replace, text search and sorting 
functions. You select a parameter by moving to it and change its' value by 
pressing the space bar.

When pointing to a parameter, you will notice that the parameter name is made 
up of two parts; a word or phrase describing the scope of the parameter, 
followed by the parameter name. There are four general types of parameters on 
this form:

1. general: These apply to all of UPAC.
2. search and replace: These apply to the search and replace function only.
3. sort: These apply to the sorting function only.
4. text search: These apply to the text search function only.

Parameter types 2, 3 and 4 handle exactly the same parameters as the selection 
forms in the coresponding functions and will not be discussed here. Suffice it 
to say, that you can change function defaults here, without having to enter 
the coresponding functions.

Parameter type 1, the general parameters set program wide defaults and can 
only be changed in this form. There are 4 general parameters. They are:

1. say full numbers
2. punctuation
3. prompt on duplicate filename
4. auto defaults

Say full numbers, is analogous to the BNS/TNS numbers mode setting and can 
either be on or off. If on, numbers will be spoken as full numbers, if off, 
they will be spoken as digits.

Punctuation, handles the speaking of punctuation and may be set to most, some, 
all or none.

Prompt on duplicate filename, determines whether you get prompted by UPAC 
before overwriting an existing file. It can either be on or off. If on, UPAC 
will prompt you before overwriting a file that already exists. When prompted, 
enter y to overwrite the file, n or Z CHORD not to overwrite. If this 
parameter is off, no prompt will be given and the existing file will simply be  
overwritten.  Copying, sorting and grade2 translations are the functions 
affected by this parameter.

Auto defaults, determines whether or not to display the individual selection 
forms in the search and replace, text search and sorting functions.  It can 
either be on or off. If on, the defaults will automatically be used and no 
selection forms will be displayed. If off, the selection forms will be 
displayed in the individual functions.


Once a parameter has been changed, it is the default until it is changed again 
either through this form or through the individual selection forms in the 
search and replace, text search and sorting functions. Note that if the auto 
defaults parameter is set to on, then the only way to change parameters for 
the search and replace, text search and sorting functions is through this 
form.  Setting auto defaults to off will once again allow for the displaying 
of the individual selection forms in the above mentioned functions.


**Saving program output
The final item on the UPAC main menu is the "save output" selection. Normally, 
when you are working in UPAC, the program speaks prompts and information, and 
then it is gone forever. Now, with this selection, you can save any output 
from the program for future use. Here's how it works.

When you point to this item for the first time, you'll notice that the menu 
item is "save output off". The quick key for this item is the > sign. 
Selecting this item, you'll notice that the menu prompt changes to "save 
output on". Now, everything that you do in UPAC, until you exit the program, 
is being written to the clipboard. After you exit UPAC, simply paste the 
clipboard into any file you wish and there will be all the information you 
gathered in your last UPAC session. If during a session you wish to 
discontinue output saving, simply point to this item again from the main menu 
and select it, or press the > sign when on the main menu. The menu item will 
change back to "save output off".

 NOTE: Save output only works in the interactive mode of UPAC, it cannot be 
used in the single command mode.  Also it is only available on units with the 
new internal hardware revisions; dated July 2, 1993 or later. If you are using 
an earlier version, this option will not even appear on the main menu.


                            ***Single command mode


**Quick key access and single command mode
Throughout this document, we have referred numerous times to quick keys and 
the single command mode. Now that you've had a chance to check out the 
interactive mode, we should say a few words about the single command mode. 
First of all, as was mentioned earlier, the quick key associated with any 
function will automatically jump to and activate that function regardless of 
where you are on the Upac menu. These quick keys have another powerful use. 

When you run Upac, it is possible to supply the program with command line 
arguments. These are entered after you've typed the name of the program and 
before you've typed enter to start the program. Command line arguments are 
separated by spaces. 

When arguments are supplied on the command line, Upac runs in single command 
mode -- that is, it performs one of its' functions and exits back to the 
operating system. 

Upac can accept up to 5 command line arguments. The first one must be either 
a string of command switches or a valid quick key combination. If the first 
argument string is a string of command switches, then the second argument MUST 
be a valid quick key combination. See the next section for a discussion of 
command switches. The next arguments are based on the quick key combination 
entered. These arguments are simply the input data entered to the various 
prompts associated with that function. 

The general syntax looks like this:

O CHORD X upac [command_switches] quick_keys [arg1] [arg2] [arg3]

The brackets indicate optional arguments. Only the quick key combination is 
required for UPAC to run in single command mode.

As we will mention in the section on command switches, the string of command 
switches MUST start with the slash character '/' and all the switches must be 
grouped together. No spaces must appear between command switches. 


**Command switches
Command switches are used to change certain aspects of UPAC operation while in 
single command mode. Unlike changing parameters in the program setup form or 
the individual selection forms, these changes are only in effect for the 
single command being carried out. The default values are reestablished after 
the single command is finished.

Command switches must preceed the quick key designation on the command line 
and must start with the slash '/' character. Multiple switches can be entered 
directly following each other. No space must exist between command switches.

The command switches for single command mode are:

a+ turn on auto defaults (no selection forms)
a- turn off auto defaults (show selection forms)
q+ turn on prompt on duplicate filename
q- turn off prompt on duplicate filename
c+ turn on case sensitivity globally
c- turn off case sensitivity globally
s+ sort in ascending order
s- sort in descending order
o(number) use (number) as sort field offset
w(number) use (number) as sort field width
l+ turn on line numbers in text search
l- turn off line numbers in text search
p+ turn on pause in text search
p- turn off pause in text search

The c+ and c- switches affect the search and replace, text search and sorting 
functions.


**EXAMPLES
A few examples of the single command syntax should be instructive at this 
point.

1. to run Upac in single command mode and perform a search and replace 
function you would enter: 

O Chord x upac s [filename] [search string] [replacement string] 

2. To search the file notes for the string hello and replace it with good-bye 
you'd type: 

O Chord x upac s notes hello good-bye 

3. To search the file temp for all line feed characters and replace them with 
nothing you would type: 

O CHORD X upac s \n \0

Notice the use of \0 for a 0-length string.

4. To count the number of lines in the currently opened file, you'd type: 

O CHORD X upac wl .

Notice in this example that the quick key combination is wl, w for the main 
menu word/line/character counting function and l for the line counting submenu 
choice. These quick key choices must be placed together with no space between 
them. Notice also the use of the period (open current file symbol). 

5. To do a guaranteed case insensitive search and replace on a file, you would 
type:

O Chord x upac /c- s [filename] [search string] [replacement string] 

Notice the use of the c (case sensitive switch) to turn off case sensitivity 
for this search.

6. To sort a file in ascending order, starting at field offset 5 and with 
field width 20, you would type:

O CHORD X upac /s+o5w20 o [file to sort] [file to receive sort]

Notice how the three switches s, o and w are grouped together with no spaces. 
Always remember that the '/' indicates a group of command switches and that 
the command switches must preceed the quick key designation.


**Summary of UPAC single command mode functions
The following list shows each Upac function along with the parameters expected 
on the command line. If any of the arguments following the quick key are 
missing, Upac will prompt for them. If the quick key supplied as arg1 is 
invalid, Upac will speak a warning and exit. 

search and replace:
s [files to search] [search string] [replacement string]

text searching
t [files to search] [string to search for]

word line and character counting:
count characters
wc [files to count]
count lines
wl [files to count]
count words
ww [files to count]
count all
wa [files to count]

copy file:
c [files to copy] [file to copy to]

append file:
a [files to append] [file to append to]

encrypt file:
e [files to encrypt/decrypt] [keyword] [keyword verification]

sort file
o [file to sort] [file to receive sorted records]

grade2 to ascii
g [files to translate] 

Note: When entering a search string, a replacement string or a keyword on the 
command line, the embedded form of the space character MUST be used since a 
normal space is interpreted as the end of a command line argument.  Use 
either \32 or \s when a string being entered on the command line requires a 
space.

As an example, the string "hello dolly" would be written as "hello\sdolly" on 
the command line.


**summary of string editing keys
Whenever you are entering strings into the UPAC program, either filenames or 
other strings, the following editing keys are available:

BNS key         TNS KEY         description
L CHORD         HOME            go to start of line
4 5 6 CHORD     END             go to end of line
B CHORD         BACKSPACE       delete character to left
dot 3 CHORD     SHIFT LEFT      move one character left
dot 6 CHORD     SHIFT RIGHT     move one character right
1 5 6 CHORD     (same)          current column on line
R CHORD         (same)          room left on line
I CHORD         INSERT          toggle between insert and overstrike mode
3 6 CHORD       SHIFT END       speak current character
D CHORD         DEL             delete current character
