        The following synthesizers have drivers available for testing, but 
        are not included with the basic JAWS demo disk:

        Sound Blaster
        Infovox
        Apollo
        Spanish Prose

        If your synthesizer is not on this list it is possible that we
        have a driver for JAWS that will support your synth.  For more info
        contact our sales team at 813-528-8900.

Step 2) If your synthesizer is listed, download the file JAWS231D.EXE and 
        create a 3.5" high density JAWS demo disk by extracting this 
        file onto your floppy disk.

Step 3) Execute the INSTALL.EXE program from your newly created demo disk.
        Follow the prompts as the install program guides you through 
        installing JAWS.

Step 4) The manual is a complete reference for how to use and configure
        JAWS 2.31, you have the option of installing this once you have
        created your JAWS demo disk.  If you pick this option the install
        program will create a JAWS MANUAL directory which contains all the
        manual files for JAWS.
